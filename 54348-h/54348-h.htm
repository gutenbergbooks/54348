<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> task of writing a book on the subject of
the Slav nations has afforded me very great
pleasure, and I hope my work will succeed in
its object and arouse the sympathies of the
British public for my race. In preference to
giving long disquisitions, I have purposely
adopted a simple narrative tone in sketching
some of the most interesting points in the national
life of the Slav peoples. I have only touched
upon historical events in so far as this was
necessary for the context, and owing to lack of
space I have been unable to do more than allude
to Slav art and literature. On the other hand,
a good deal of valuable information on this
subject will be found in the epilogue “Buried
Treasures,” which the eminent Serbo-Croat
essayist, Mr. Dimitrij Mitrinović has kindly
placed at my disposal.</p>

<p>As I am at present completely cut off from my
sorely-stricken country, I have been unable to
apply for permission to quote from certain books
that I have consulted, but I feel sure that my
literary colleagues, Dr. Dragutin Prohaska, Niko
Županić and Dr. Gjuro Šurmin, will not object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
to my having had recourse to their works in
the interests of our race.</p>

<p>I am also indebted to Mr. Frano Supilo, the
leader to the Croatian people, as well as to my
above-mentioned friend, Mr. Dimitrij Mitrinovič;
of the Serbian Legation in London, for several
valuable hints.</p>

<p>My special thanks are due to my translator,
Mme. Fanny S. Copeland, and Miss Ella C. Seyfang,
who have given me invaluable assistance in my
work.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>THE SLAV RACE.</small></h3>

<p class="indent f85">Slav Characteristics&mdash;Slav Power in the Past&mdash;The
Decline&mdash;The Dawn?</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Although</span> the Slav race does not appear as a
united state or Union, it certainly forms a family
of nations linked by ties of blood, the tradition
of centuries, similar language and customs,
and especially by ties of mutual love and sympathy.
It is the greatest and most powerful of
the European races, yet to this day it does not
hold the pride of place which is its due and which
it once held. Not the precedence of mere
strength, which is surely sufficiently represented
by Russia, but the place due to a people of
recognized culture, who have not yet been justly
appreciated in spite of overwhelming proof of
their intellectual gifts. Slavs are still popularly
supposed to be a mentally undeveloped
host of semi-barbarians and troglodytes. Of
course the educated public of Europe has long<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
abandoned this attitude; but it has done little
to spread a more just and liberal view among
the people at large.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> The German scholars
made it their business to lay stress on “Slav
barbarism” wherever possible, to obscure the
bright and glorious pages in Slav history, and
to emphasize everything that can be taken as a
proof of savagery and arrested development.
Unfortunately, no one has written at such length
about the Slav question, or attached so much
importance to it, as the German scholars, with
the result that other European nations have
derived their views from them&mdash;so much so
that one might almost say that <em>German</em> opinion
on the Slavs has become the opinion of Europe.
Constant unrest in Russia, and the consequent
reprisals of the authorities afforded a welcome
pretext for misjudging the Slavs, and the ordinary
public of Europe came to know of them
only as mediæval inquisitors with Siberia as
their great torture-chamber. No one seemed
to realize that these revolutionary movements,<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
no less than the insurrections in other Slav
countries, merely represented the resistance of
a virile people craving enlightenment against
autocratic barbarism; and that it is obviously
unfair to judge the Slavs by the deeds of their
<em>oppressors</em>, who in every case have followed
the German methods cultivated by their governments
in most Slav countries, and imported
into Russia by Peter the Great. On the other
hand, if the Slav nations are judged by the <em>soul
of the people</em>, and not by their rulers and state-systems,
they show a high standard of civilization
and a trend towards culture of a kindly,
humanitarian type, which promises to be a
far better contribution to Western European
progress than the much-advertised German
“Kultur.”</p>

<p>Certainly the Slavs have not yet attained to
their full stature as a race. At present they
are passing through a period of strong ferment,
but the wine that has so far resulted from this
ferment gives excellent ground for the hope
that when the Slavs have solved their various
national and economic problems they will prove
themselves the equals of the other cultured
nations of the world.</p>

<p>In the world of politics they must attain the
degree of power necessary to safeguard their
racial individuality and the freedom of the
Slav peoples. This power must stand in due
proportion to their capability for intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
progress, and should in itself be a guarantee for
the peace of the world in the future. For the
Slav is not naturally domineering, and has no
craving for power as a mere means of aggression.
He belongs to a kindly race, melancholy, as shown
in the national poetry in which his soul finds
expression. He has a craving to love and to be
loved, and would fain join the other European
nations as a friend and brother. His strength will
be the strength of love. Russia has neither need
nor desire to extend her boundaries further. The
Balkan Slavs only wish to accomplish their own
destiny quietly within the borders of the <em>Slav
Sphere</em>, and the rest of the Slavs desire their
freedom&mdash;<em>only their freedom</em>. And when this
is accomplished, the Slav Colossus will no longer
constitute a danger to Europe, but a safeguard.
His political power will only threaten those who
would tamper with the foundations of peace from
mere lust of dominion.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<p>In the present crisis the Slav race is by no
means seeking a return to the past. The past has
seen the Slavs masters of a great empire and a
real menace to the rest of the world. If one
were to take the political map of Europe and
indicate upon it the frontiers of the ancient
Slav Empire, the Slav race would appear like an
irresistible deluge. The huge Muscovite Empire,
almost the whole of Austria-Hungary, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
of the Balkans, two-thirds of the German Empire,
part of Italy, and a large part of Scandinavia&mdash;all
these once formed the Slav Empire. Historical
maps show the single triumphant word
“Slavs” (“famous” or “glorious” ones) inscribed
over all these countries throughout the
centuries. Their history and development can
be traced back to 400 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The Taurians that guarded the Golden Fleece
were Slavs, as were the men of the Baltic with
whom Phœnicians and Greeks traded for amber.
The forest lands of the North, that grey home
of magic, wisdom and valour, hang like a dark
background full of strange possibilities behind
sunny Greece and clear-headed, practical Rome&mdash;and
this was the Empire of the Slavs in the
past, the Gardariki and Iotunheim (Giant-land)
of the Norsemen. From one century to another
they played a part of increasing importance
among the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe
and were feared as a strong, homogeneous race.
Their power reached its zenith towards the end
of the fifth century, before the tidal wave of the
Hun invasion swept over Europe. At that time
they held the mastery from the Alps to the
mouth of the Elbe, and from the Baltic to the
Black Sea. They were then one great people
divided into several tribes speaking slightly
differing dialects; but only a fraction of their
number&mdash;the inhabitants of the present Dalmatia&mdash;was
subject to the Emperor Nepos. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
invasion of the Avars, who took possession of a
large strip of the Slav possessions between the
Danube and the Dniester, made the first breach
in the unity of the great Slav family. Henceforth
they were known as Northern, Eastern, and
Southern, Slavs, and began to form separate
nationalities. In the age of Charlemagne these
nationalities had already crystallized into independent
states, whose power and prosperity are
recorded in history. The strongest of these
was eventually Poland, extending far into the
Russia of to-day. The Moravian Empire of
Svatopluk, the Empire of Serbia, the kingdom
of Croatia, and the Slavicized Bulgars in the
South, together with the Grand-Dukedom of
Muscovy (and the Wendish kingdom in North
Germany), complete the family of Slav States.
It would take too long to enter into the historical
importance of all these states, but it is a
characteristic proof of their power that not only
European, but Asiatic, nations courted their
favour.</p>

<p>Some of the main trade routes of the world
led from Northern Europe through the heart of
Russia to Byzantium (the “Mikligard” of the
Sagas)&mdash;and Asia. Slav, Norwegian, Tatar and
Arab traded peacefully together on the banks
of the Volga, and sundry passages in the Norse
Sagas as well as the journal of an Arab trader
give us vivid glimpses of those days. Somehow
these searchlight pictures of the Slavs and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
country, recorded with positively journalistic
freshness and love of detail, do not corroborate
the biassed accounts of German historians.
But this world-power which Russia alone has
developed steadily up to the present day began to
wane among the other Slav nations soon after
the first Crusade (1097). Already in 1204 (the
fourth Crusade) Slavonia, Croatia, Dalmatia
and Bosnia were incorporated in the German
(Holy Roman) Empire, together with Hungary,
Istria, Carniola and Carinthia. Under the
Hohenstaufens, Bohemia and Moravia also became
vassal states, and in the fourteenth century
the victorious Osmanlis robbed the Bulgars and
Serbs of their independence. With the exception
of Russia, Poland alone maintained her
independence, until the first partition in 1772,
followed by the second in 1793. The third and
last partition in 1795 sealed her fate, and the
Poles were parcelled out under Russian, Prussian
and Austrian rule.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<p>The partition of Poland was the beginning of
the complete political, and to some extent even
the national, decay of the non-Russian Slavs.
Just as Russia began to spread her mighty
pinions, the Slavs under alien yoke fell deeper
and deeper into an apathy of gloom, only broken
from time to time by rare flashes of patriotism,
or a tempest of revolt. The book of history lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
open before them with its pages of gold and
black; but to their aching eyes the black ever
loomed larger than the gold, and they yielded to
a despondency that knew no comfort and saw
no escape. And, while they were thus sunk in
apathy, their rulers brought strong pressure to
bear on them, so that they might eradicate the
stamp of their nationality, not only from their
faces, but from their souls. Germany and
Austria scented the Eastern question, and
divined that in its solution the Slavs might renew
their strength. So they determined to approach
the problem supported by a totally emasculated
and denationalized Slav following. To this end
they strove above all things to turn the Slavs
into docile citizens of a Germanic Empire; for
from the days of Charlemagne the German has
reiterated the parrot-cry that the Slav is barbarous,
obstinate, dangerous and ugly, and that
his only chance of salvation lies in merging his
identity with that of the German of the Empire.
It is a fact that during this period the Slavs did
nothing to help themselves. A great weariness
weighed upon the people, no less than upon the
educated classes, and they were preparing to
reconcile themselves to the fate that had already
befallen their brothers, the Serbs and Bulgars.
But the progress of history did for the Slavs
what they failed to do for themselves. Napoleon,
the personification of destruction for the whole of
Europe, brought salvation to the Western Slavs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
for he re-awakened them to a sense of national
self-consciousness, and so prepared the way for
the long and bitter struggle they have waged
since then against their oppressors. As soon
as these struggles commenced Russia, who had
hitherto regarded the ruin of her brothers with
equanimity, began to take an interest in their
sufferings, and to afford them strong moral
support.</p>

<p>These struggles, however, could not bring
immediate relief. The Slavs knew full well that
the way to freedom is long and has to be won
step by step. The problem of the Near East,
which advanced one stage with the liberation of
Serbia, must first be solved in every phase and
detail to clear the way for a solution of the
purely Slav problem. Europe cannot take a vital
interest in this problem before the Balkan
problem is disposed of, and the conditions for the
liberation of the Slavs so far fulfilled, that the
difficulty can be solved in the ordinary course of
the progress of civilization.</p>

<p>The psychological moment seems to have
arrived, and the Slav question deserves to be
fully put forward. Surely the British public,
which has entered into the present crisis with
such splendid spirit, will not withhold its interest
from the Slav question, more especially as
England will have a strong voice in the matter
when the final settlement comes to be made.</p>

Russians&mdash;Cossacks&mdash;The People of the Sunflower&mdash;Made

<h4>I.</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Roughly</span> speaking, there are 172 million Slavs
in the world. The Russians alone number about
110 millions, and these millions occupy a vast
country reaching from the snows of the far
North, to lands where the orange-trees bloom all
the year round. The Russian holds that his
dear “little mother Russia” is the most beautiful
land of all the earth. The mountain fastnesses
and precipices of the Urals, the green slopes of
the Caucasus, the Siberian wastes, the grey
shores of the Baltic and the sunny shores of the
Euxine&mdash;the Volga and the Don, and even the
sacred steppes&mdash;to him they are all beautiful, to
him they reflect the image of his soul and his
feelings. The Western traveller will find some
difficulty in understanding this passionate love
of the Russian for his country, and will feel<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
tempted to draw sharp comparisons between the
degrees of beauty in the various districts. But
the landscape of Russia is as peculiar as the
Russian people. It is as Russian as the Russian
himself. There is probably not another country
in the world where the climatic and geological
conditions have so deeply influenced the inmost
character of the people, even to their external
features. Where the landscape is beautiful and
the climate sunny, the handsome noble Russian
type prevails; whereas the cold, inhospitable
tracts produce the characteristic wide-faced,
flat-nosed type. Yet there is a strange resemblance
between the rough type and the handsome
type analogous to that which a careful
observer cannot fail to notice between the
different types of Russian landscape. For
though the steppe is grey, and the fields of
Caucasia are green, yet both are animated by
something that wears the same countenance,
breathes the same purely Russian atmosphere,
and is suffused with the same wonderful charm.
It is the charm of perfectly balanced contrast.
The soil of Russia has a soul like the soul of her
children, for whom she cares and lives and
breathes. This soul appears everywhere the
same; it exhales the same perfume from the
dry grass of the steppe as from the Crimean
groves of syringa.</p>

<p>The Russian soil is fertile, inexhaustively
fertile, as if it were conscious of the millions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
dependent upon it. Metaphorically speaking,
this soil produces its gifts out of itself, and
offers them lavishly to its children. The Russian
never works more than he is obliged to&mdash;he
need not wrestle with the soil, he need only not
forget it. But he tills it with love; he does not
force the gifts of Nature, he coaxes them from
her, and where these fruits do not appear on
the surface, he seeks them in the heart of the
earth, and goes down the coal-shafts and lead-mines
with the same serene confidence with
which he ploughs the sunlit surface. Is he not
still with his “little mother”?</p>

<p>The Russian is a farmer by nature. The
great industrial developments of the last decades
have resulted automatically from the natural
wealth of the country, but the true Russian
reaps little benefit from this industrial boom.
His commercial gifts are not great, and he has
been content to leave the business exploitation
of the country in the hands of foreigners, so
long as he makes his own little profit. Mills
and factories are “German monsters” in his
eyes, and he prefers to give them a wide berth.
But latterly there has been a great agitation in
favour of the resuscitation of all home industries.
The Russian has grasped the fact that his policy
of sentiment in business will have to be modified
to suit modern times, and that the welfare of
the people must not be dependent on foreign
middle-men. The present great conflict with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
the Germans, who have hitherto so largely
monopolised Russian industry, will doubtless do
much to further this movement towards industrial
emancipation.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<p>The History of Russia begins practically with
Rurik (862) who is supposed to have come from
Scandinavia and laid the foundations of a
Russian state.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> At the coming of Rurik the
Russians were split up into many separate communities
under independent chiefs. Rurik introduced
a new spirit of united organization, and
all efforts towards establishing a Russian Empire
date from him. Of course it was inevitable
that this founding of an Empire should involve
much opposition, revolt, war, and bloodshed.
Each district was proud and jealous of its independence,
and only yielded after a hard and
bitter struggle. During the period of Empire-making
Russian history abounds in such bloody
episodes. The Grand-Dukedom of Muscovy was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
the largest of the Russian petty States and in
every way the best equipped, so that the task of
organization naturally devolved upon it, together
with the fruits of victory. Six centuries of
ceaseless struggle against foes from without and
within bring us from Rurik’s day to the accession
of Ivan Vassilievitch III. (1462-1505), who is
regarded as the founder of Russian Tsardom.
He incorporated the still independent principalities
of Twer, Moshnik, and Vologda with the
Grand-Dukedom of Muscovy, defeated the powerful
Republic of Novgorod, and freed himself
completely from the Tatar yoke (1480). In
1472 he married Zoë, a daughter of Thomas
Palaeologus, the brother of the last Byzantine
Emperor. European customs were first brought
into Russia through this princess, and the double-headed
eagle of Byzantium introduced in the
Russian coat of arms. The celebrated Uspenskij
and Blagoveshchenski Cathedrals in Moskva
were built in the reign of Ivan Vassilievitch III.
He promulgated a decree pronouncing the realm
henceforth united and undivisible by law, and
was the first Russian ruler to assume the title
of “Tsar of all the Russias.” Christianity, introduced
by St. Vladimir (980-1054), had by this
time fully blossomed forth as the national religion,
so that we can date the foundation of “Holy
Russia” of to-day in all her greatness from the
age of Ivan Vassilievitch III.</p>

<p>During the following ages the power of Tsardom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
increased and finally reached its zenith with
Peter the Great, who may be called the first of
the modern Russian Tsars. He applied his own
acquired Western knowledge to Russia, and
enormously improved the general status of the
realm. In his reign Russia began to play her
part as a political and military power, for it was
he who founded the Russian navy and mercantile
marine. He was a ruthless autocrat, and many
pages of his reign are traced in blood; yet with
him autocracy was not so much a matter of sentiment
as of dire necessity. He loved his Russian
people passionately, but said that it was a people
who had to be made great by force. Confident
in the inalienable national character he saw
no danger in importing foreigners wholesale to
help in the building up of Russian administration.
He surrounded himself with German advisers,
appointed Germans to responsible offices, and
freely admitted the German element into Russia
as a means of spreading “culture.” In many
ways German thoroughness proved a most useful
asset in carrying out the Tsar’s intentions. On
the other hand it gave rise to a dynasty and
an autocratic aristocracy of foreign stock who
failed to understand the Russian people, and
whose influence proved disastrous to civilization
and intellectual freedom in Russia. <em>Outwardly</em>,
Russia became a world-power under Peter the
Great, but <em>internally</em> it fell a prey to a system
of spiritual slavery, which has been perpetuated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
even to recent years by the successors of Peter
and their councillors, the descendants of German
immigrants. <em>Here lies the true cause of the
revolutionary movement of more than a century.</em>
The last three Tsars of Russia&mdash;the two Alexanders
and the present Tsar&mdash;have taken steps to
eliminate the great evil, and if, so far, they have
only been partially successful, the fault lies not
with them nor with the Russian people, but with
the <em>still German</em> mind of their advisers. The
abolition of serfdom, repeated constitutional
manifestos and the introduction of the Duma
system are momentous steps towards a brighter
future. But the gate to this future can only be
fully opened with the conclusion of the present
war.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>Although Russia has acquired millions of non-Russian
subjects&mdash;chiefly through the Crimea,
Bessarabia and her Asiatic possessions&mdash;she has
never lost her purely Russian character. The
laws concerning land purchase are so constituted
that the territories belonging to the heart of
Russia cannot to any great extent pass into non-Russian
hands, which accounts for the fact that
these parts of the Empire have remained essentially
Russian. Siberia holds an exceptional
position, and is to-day a great colonial province<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
with a mixed population. Every year the
wealth and fertility of Siberia become more
and more apparent, and instead of being bleak
and uninhabited, this country is now distinctly
populous. The horrors of Siberia as a penal
colony are becoming a thing of the past, and only
the perpetrators of grave crimes are still condemned
to labour in the lead-mines and languish
in the Katorga (penal servitude). Convicts who
are simply exiled to Siberia are able to earn a
comfortable livelihood under tolerable conditions&mdash;apart
from the loss of liberty and vexatious
police supervision. Thus it often happens that
time-expired convicts prefer to remain in Siberia,
and eventually find not only a home but prosperity
in the new country.</p>

<p>Siberia, the Crimea and Bessarabia are all
three interesting as countries and as Russian
territories, but in a sketch of the Russian people
they are unimportant. The true Russian stock
falls into three great bodies, the “Bielorussi”
(White Russians), the “Velikorussi” (Great
Russians) and the “Malorussi” (Little Russians).
They represent the North, the Centre and the
South of Russia. Ethnologically, economically,
and intellectually the White Russians represent
the lowest type. They inhabit the Northern
tracts from the borders of Poland, ancient
Lithuania, and Novgorod. The governments of
Minsk, Litav, and Smaljensk are their central
provinces. Theirs is a poverty-stricken and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
one might add, a slothful Russia. Agricultural
facilities are limited, the soil is not very fertile,
and the White Russian is not sufficiently industrious
or persevering to improve it by rational
farming. The people are more apathetic than
elsewhere in Russia, and less inclined to adopt
modern ideas with enthusiasm. These people
become nervous and excitable only when menaced
by a dearth of food; then their attitude is
often much more dangerous than the tide of
social revolution. At least the White Russian
has kept his type fairly pure and in spite of alien
neighbours he shows little trace of racial admixture.</p>

<p>The Little Russians, who inhabit the entire
South of Russia, and from whose stock the famous
Cossacks are sprung, differ most radically from
their northern brothers. They are the excitable,
hot-blooded, dare-devil Russians. In type the
men are fine-looking and handsome almost
without exception, and the women often exceedingly
beautiful. Their language differs from
other Russian speech by the extreme softness of
the dialect (which is not unlike Serbo-Croatian),
and their music and poetry are the finest in the
Slav race. In the past the Little Russians were
divided into many small and independent clans
who outvied each other in reckless warlike
enterprises. Of course the wonderful Cossacks
always took the lead. They still occupy their
original home on the Don and in Caucasia, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
furnish the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</em> of the Russian Army, even as they
once were the flower of the Little Russian tribes.
Moreover, they preserved to the very last their
freedom and their privileges in Russia. To-day
one is accustomed to look upon the Cossacks as
merely a body of men especially devoted to the
Tsar, but, as a matter of fact, the Cossack people
have had a most chequered and interesting past.
Once they formed an independent warrior-nation,
feared and courted by their neighbours; and so
secure in their strength did they feel, that they
even dared to answer the Turkish Sultan’s demand
for submission with a letter of taunting derision
(the well-known Cossack Ultimatum). They
played a great part in the history of Russia, and
each Russian ruler in turn endeavoured to assure
himself of their support. After their final subjection
to Russia (1851) the Cossacks gradually
exchanged their political importance for their
present military value. Tolstoi wrote about
them as follows&mdash;though his remarks really
apply to the whole of the Little Russian people:
“Many years ago the ancestors of the Cossacks,
who were ‘Old Believers,’ fled from Russia
and settled on the banks of the Terek (Caucasus).
They are a handsome, prosperous and warlike
Russian population, who still retain the
faith of their fathers. Dwelling among the
Chechentzes, the Cossacks intermarried with them
and acquired the usages, customs and mode of
living of these mountaineers. But their Russian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
tongue and their ancient faith they preserved in
all their pristine purity.... To this day the
kinship between certain Cossack families and the
Chechentzes is clearly recognizable and a love
of freedom and idleness, a delight in raiding and
warfare are their chief characteristics. Their
love of display in dress is an imitation of the
Circassians. The Cossack procures his admirable
weapons from his mountaineer neighbours, and
also buys or ‘lifts’ his best horses from them.
All Cossacks are fond of boasting of their knowledge
of the Tatar tongue. At the same time this
small Christian people considers itself highly
developed, and the Cossack only as a full human
being. They despise all other nationalities....
Every Cossack has his own vineyard, and presses
his own wine, and his immoderate drinking is
not so much due to inclination as to sacred
custom, to neglect which would be regarded as
a kind of apostasy.... Women he looks upon
as a means for promoting his prosperity. Only
the young girls are allowed by him to enjoy any
leisure: from a married woman he demands
a life of drudgery from early youth to old age,
and he is quite Oriental in expecting deference and
hard work from his wife.... The Cossack who
considers it unbefitting in the presence of
strangers to exchange a kind or affectionate
word with his wife involuntarily feels her
superiority as soon as he is alone with her.
For the whole of his house and farm are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
acquired through her and maintained by her
labour and care....”</p>

<p>Between these extremes of Northern and
Southern Russia, the Great Russian stands out
like a beacon or an indestructible landmark. He
represents the <em>purest</em> type of the Russian people,
the children of “matyushfia Moskva.” Whatever
Russia has produced in the way of true
greatness in every sense of the words, has its
cradle in Great Russia, and has been nursed at
the breast of Mother Moskva. This truly Russian
people inhabits the huge central tracts of Russia,
and the governments of Moskva and Novgorod
are their particular home. The Russian faith
owes its beauty, the Russian ideal its purity to
this people, and to the race they have given the
<em>All-Slav Ideal</em>. And they are the only Russian
people whose soul has two faces, an outer and an
inner one. The Russian sculptor Tsukoff has
symbolized them in a figure resembling a sunflower.
It is as well to know that the Great
Russian cannot live without sunflower-seeds.
He calls them “podsolnushki.” Everything is
smothered in “podsolnushki” shells&mdash;streets,
floors of rooms and railway carriages, even the
corners in the churches. Every Great Russian
munches “podsolnushki,” and by temperament
he himself is a “podsolnushki.” He has an outer
shell and a kernel. In Russia the sunflower is
queen of the flowers, and as the sunflower is
among the flowers so is the Great Russian among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
the Russian peoples. He is the true “tsarkiya
Rus.” The Tsar is the sun, the heart of the
realm, and the Muscovite people are the “podsolnushki.”
Each individual is only one among
many, a particle, a seed for the propagation and
glorification of his own race. Probably, the Great
Russian has no equal in the world as regards
idyllic simplicity. Not because he munches
“podsolnushki,” crosses himself in tram-cars
when passing a church, goes about in big boots
in the heat of summer, and drinks vodka, wine
and beer without regard to time or season, but
because he is a true yeoman soul. He is quite
indifferent to all that does not interest him
personally. The surface of his soul is as hard
and impervious as the shell of the sunflower seed.
His face wears an imperturbable, changeless
expression. To reach the kernel of his <em>human</em>
soul one has to discard every formality, thrust
aside every obstacle, and <em>bite</em> into it as if it were
a sunflower seed. If you abuse him roundly and
“have it out” with him, he suddenly shows
himself in his true colours, the best and kindliest
of souls; but if you handle him with kid gloves
you will never get a glimpse of his inner nature.
As an acquaintance the charm of the Great
Russian consists chiefly in his sudden transition
from sharp resistance to an unexpected exhibition
of gentle, unaffected loveableness. The Great
Russian has a strong natural talent for philosophy,
but, metaphorically speaking, his philosophy is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
as vegetarian as his cooking has largely remained
to this day. There is a scent of dried herbs,
new-mown hay, and southern-wood about it; it
recalls dark forests where the sunlight, piercing
the rifts between the tree-tops, shines with golden-blue,
unearthly splendour&mdash;a ray of the light
Divine. His philosophy is innocent of blood
like the saints of the old ikons.</p>

<p>This Great Russian people is the flower of
Russia, the Sunflower, whose golden petals point
the way for the future of the whole Russian
nation.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<p>The problem of Russian culture has its roots
in the Russian <em>people</em>, and not in the educated
classes. The desire for culture has emanated
from the people themselves, and the spirit they
evinced has pointed the way for the educated
classes in the great struggle for national culture
within recent years. The educated man is the
interpreter of the popular demand for culture,
and of the intellectual wealth dwelling in the soul
and mind of the Russian people. Almost the
whole of Russian art and literature is derived from
this source, and it has never shown the world so
much the genius of the poet, painter, or the
sculptor in question, as the genius of the Russian
people that produced him; and the best that is
revealed in Russian art is the face of the Russian
soul with its manifold aspects of thinker, philosopher,
and purely human being. Dostoievski,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Tolstoi, Gogol, Gontsharoff, Tshekhoff, Gorki and
Andreeff in poetry; Repin, Vasnetsoff, Tsukoff,
Troubetzkoy and many others in the pictorial arts;&mdash;all
have learnt what they had to tell from the
soul of the people and the <em>wisdom</em> of this soul;
and the Great Russian musicians have used the
voice of the people throughout for the expression
of their art. They are all of them merely interpreters
of the rich fund of culture, the latent
culture of the Russian people. This latent
culture, in conjunction with the holy Russian
faith, has advanced towards the highest development
of human dignity and nobility, towards
peace founded not upon blood, but upon love.
The abuse the Germans have heaped upon
Russian barbarism is merely the outcome of
envious rage on the part of an inferior, who sees
his artificial pseudo-culture endangered by another
culture which blossoms from the depths of the
human heart.</p>

<p>The non-Russian Slavs stood for a long time
under the influence of German culture. With
their characteristic aggressiveness the Germans
represented their culture as the high-water mark
of civilization and inculcated it everywhere with
the same violence which at present distinguishes
the advance of their invading hordes. Even
nations possessing a peerless millennial culture,
like the French and Italians, have found it difficult
to escape their influence. But a sham must
inevitably die of its own exposure. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
people, every nation has its own peculiar
susceptibility, a kind of instinctive taste, which
refuses to tolerate anything that does not appeal
to its soul, and could act destructively upon it.
The peoples of the West have for some time past
boycotted the “Williamitic” culture, and only
sundry isolated Slav peoples have admitted it&mdash;principally
those who were practically dependent
on Germany, and whose native culture was
forcibly suppressed. The result was that a few
years ago a non-Russian Slav knew his sentimental
Schiller better than his Dante, Lenau better than
his Pushkin, Kleist better than Shakespeare, and
Gottfried Keller better than Dostoievski. In
the Slav schools in Austria-Hungary the German
language is obligatory as the official language
(the other languages are to this day not permitted
in the schools), German history is taught
as the standard of national greatness and civilization
and German literature and art as practically
unique and unequalled. All that bore the hallmark
“Made in Germany” was inculcated as
ideal. Thus it was not at all strange that German
culture has for a long time predominated among
these Slavs. But the Slav instinct always
hated this culture, though at first unconsciously,
and sensed it as a false and treacherous enemy.
Then Russia began her intellectual campaign
among the Slavs. At first it was an uphill
struggle, for the Government authorities placed
every possible obstacle in the way of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
propaganda. But when the Slav peoples realized
that the Russian influence could only reach them
as forbidden fruit, they began greatly to desire it.
To the power of the State they opposed the
power of their will and their instincts. This
struggle is still in progress, but it has been
uniformly successful in favour of the Russian
influence. During the ’eighties the results of
this influence began to show fruit, and since
that time Slav intellectual and educational
development has safely entered the fairway of
Russian intellectualism. Art and literature have
followed the lines laid down by Russia, and
become more definitely Slavonic. The latent
mental wealth and resources of the Slav nations
have come to the surface and appear pure and
unaffected and entirely free from German “angularity,”
while their social problems betray a
distinct kinship with the Russian social movement.
In recent years this process of emancipation
and affiliation has so far developed that it
has entered the field of politics and materialized
in the <em>Russian protectorate over all the Slavs</em>.
This, however, required no propaganda&mdash;it arose
out of itself, as will appear in the chapters dealing
with the other Slav nations.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br /><br />

<small>RUSSIAN NATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS.</small></h3>

<p class="indent f85">Russian Slavdom&mdash;The Mir&mdash;Stress and Famine&mdash;The
Duma&mdash;Russian Literature&mdash;Gogol, Tolstoi, Dostoievski&mdash;Realistic
Ideals&mdash;The Russian Soul.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> eminent Russian publicist Menschikoff, in
one of his works on Russian nationalism, writes
the following: “In a world-wide sense only we
Russians are Slavs and&mdash;unfortunately&mdash;so far
no one else. The other Slav nationalities are so
dismembered, so stupidly and artificially kept
apart and hostile among themselves, that they
scarcely count either politically or otherwise.
The majority of the Outer Slav nations are still
under the German, Hungarian or Turkish yoke,
and at present they are quite unable to shake
off this yoke. There are many reasons for the
decline of the Western Slavs, but the principal
one is the <em>negative</em> type of their character and
the consequent tendency to dissensions and
mutual jealousies.... Even as regards national
culture, Russia&mdash;in spite of all her internal
miseries&mdash;takes the lead among the Slav nations.
In every respect she has the right to say: ‘I
am Slavdom.<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>’”</p>

<p>The somewhat bitter tone adopted towards
the other Slav nations in this dictum might easily
be modified by an appeal to evidence, but, for
all that, Menschikoff’s remarks are correct in
essentials. The truth of his assertion as to the
world-wide importance of the Russians and the
relative unimportance of the other Slavs to-day
must be freely admitted. And that is why a
special interest attaches to the question of the
Russian people. It is too early in the day to
judge of the full significance of the Russians as
a factor in the world’s development, for they
have scarcely yet come into their own. The birth
of the Russian people has been in progress for
the last century. First the head appeared&mdash;<em>Russian
literature</em>, and then slowly, deliberately,
the giant body&mdash;the <em>Russian people</em>, who are
gradually attaining to political and national
self-consciousness.</p>

<p>Till 1861 the Russian people led an embryonic
existence within the womb of Holy Mother
Russia. A nobility of mixed Mongolian, German,
British, French and even Negroid (Pushkin)
stock ate, breathed and thought for the people.
Most foreigners imagine that the Russian people
were “emancipated” in 1861. But this emancipation
was only partial, and more apparent than
real; for though serfdom had been abolished,
there still remained the heavier yoke of the “Mir”&mdash;a
conservative, iron-bound institution, which has
greatly hindered the development of the Russian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
people by restricting the liberty of the individual.
Strictly speaking, the “Mir” was the village or
parish, but in an economic sense it was the
association of several families under one head.
The Slavophil writers, Homiakoff and the brothers
Kirieyevaki, with their followers down to Pobyedonszeff
saw in the “Mir” a guarantee, not
only for the welfare of Russia, but for all the
world. They believed the “Mir” to be that
economic communism and moral brotherhood
which Western Social Democracy is vainly trying
to discover in other ways. They held that the
“Mir” was destined to assure the future of
the Russian people and to afford it the means
of solving all the social problems of the world
in accordance with the laws of justice and of
love. Russian literature is full of poems, treatises,
and religious contemplations in praise of it.
Even the greatest Russian minds, such as Dostoievski
himself, were smitten with this idea.
No “Western” doctrine was potent to disabuse
the Russians of their fallacy. Nature herself
had to come to the rescue, destroy the chimera
and lead Russia back to the high road of common
sense and progress.</p>

<p>It happened very simply. The periodic famine
arose in Russia, and the vast Empire, the
“granary of the world,” had no bread for
millions of her honest, hard-working children.
They could not understand how there could be
a famine in a fertile, sparsely populated country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
whilst the teeming populations of the Western
countries had enough to eat. The starving Russian
people argued that the famine was caused
by an insufficiency of <em>land</em>, and that they had
been cozened in 1861 when the land was divided
up between the nobles and the peasants. The
result was a growing ill-feeling against the
ruling classes, to whom the peasantry still had
to pay “redemption-dues” either in money or
in kind. In accordance with ancient custom
the “Mir” periodically divided the land among
its members. Obviously, in many communities
there was not enough land for each member.
Result&mdash;Famine. The “Mir” was self-governing,
and had the same powers over its
members as formerly the lord of the soil. It
exercised a paternal jurisdiction, punished with
blows, or with banishment to Siberia, divided
the land, collected taxes, issued travellers’ passes,
and often made itself arbitrarily unpleasant.
During the ’nineties it became increasingly
evident that the “Mir” constituted a moral
and material danger to the people. Poor harvests
followed by famine were the bane of the
people from 1871 till 1907 and even as lately
as 1911.</p>

<p>Space forbids me to enter into the agrarian
crises&mdash;questions of reform, experiments and
reactions, which loom so large in the pages of
modern Russian history. Suffice it to say that
all this led up to the revolution in 1905, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
in consequence of this revolution the Government
decided upon a step it might equally well have
taken in 1861. In 1906 the Government decided
partially to dissolve the “Mirs,” and by establishing
freehold farm properties owned by <em>individuals</em>
it created the yeoman farmer class
with full civic rights. This reform which was
only fully carried through in 1911, marks the
beginning of a new political era for the Russian
man of the people. It is still too soon to feel
the consequences of this truly great reform to
their full extent. The Russian peasant has
scarcely got used to his new position of individual
freedom, and has not yet learnt to give
effect to his political and social will. There
can be no question of a constitution so long as the
“Muzhik” has not attained to the full stature
of a citizen and agriculturist. In Russia we
speak of a “first Duma,” a “second Duma,” a
“third Duma,” whereas no one in the rest of
Europe would speak of a “first,” “second,” or
“third” Parliament, but simply of “the Parliament.”
These “first,” “second,” “third” and
now “fourth” Dumas are simply so many editions
of one and the same Duma, with each edition
more rigorously pruned by the Government, till
the merest shadow is all that remains. At this
moment the entire social structure of Russia is
analogous to this Duma-system. The Russian
world of intellect is no more entitled to represent
the Russian people, than the fourth Duma is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
represent the first. The Russian intellectuals
may speak in the name of the people, but their
word is really no better than a third-hand
account. Even when there is no attempt at
falsification, they always stand at a certain
distance from the people. Whatever the great
Russian realists have written concerning their
own people is merely intuitive conjecture from
a distance. A poet projects his own world into
the people. The psychology of the great Russian
writers of fiction is a <em>tendency</em>, an illusion based
not on exact, but on intuitive knowledge of the
people. Russian realism borders on the visionary,
and on mysticism. Europe has hitherto failed
to discern the actual foundations of this poetry
in its relation to Russian life, and has simply
allowed herself to be fascinated by the “keen
psychology” of the writers. The result has been
a false impression. The facts are really different&mdash;instead
of <em>real truthfulness</em> we find in the Russian
writer a realistic tendency, a <em>real ethical resentment</em>;
thence the increased “keenness” of his
psychology, the critical touch in his imagination,
which gives such a striking effect of verisimilitude.
European critics have never detected the seam
in the fabric of the Russian novel; they have
accepted the masterpiece as the outcome of a
single creative inspiration. Even though Russian
realism comes nearer to life than that of any
other literature, still it is more art than life.</p>

<p>Proof of this is to be found in Gogol’s private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
correspondence. He frequently complained that
nobody would send him “copy” from Russian
life. He begs in vain for hints, anecdotes and
descriptions; he has to “invent” his stories,
and is ashamed of having to “deceive” his
reader. In his immortal comedy, “The Revising
Inspector,” Gogol satirizes his own “untruthfulness,”
and in Hlestakoff, the great adventurer,
who is mistaken by every one for the real revising
inspector, he ridicules himself. For the sake of
the people Gogol consents to play the “revising
inspector!” But Gogol’s “untruthfulness” is
simply creative genius. An eminent Tolstoi
student, Osvianiko-Kulikovsky, has plainly
asserted that even Tolstoi was not of the soul
of the people but of the soul of the gentry.
Tolstoi is a “<em>barin</em>” (landlord) and he thinks
and feels only as a <em>barin</em>. Turgenyeff was
blamed even during his lifetime for writing
about Russia without knowing it; for he practically
never lived in Russia.</p>

<p>The inmost soul of the Russian people has,
however, found an excellent representative in
Dostoievski. “Do not judge the Russian people”&mdash;pleads
Dostoievski&mdash;“by the atrocious deeds
of which they have often been guilty, but by
those great and holy matters to which they aspire
in their depravity. And not all the people are
depraved. There are saints among them, who
shed their light upon all, to show them the way.”</p>

<p>Dostoievski himself was such a light and such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
saint. His works reflect the character of the
Russian clearly and faithfully as it is:</p>

<p>“In the Russian man of the people one must
discriminate between his innate beauty and the
product of barbarism. Owing to the events of
the whole history of Russia, the Russian has been
at the mercy of every depraving influence, he has
been so abused and tortured that it is a miracle
that he has preserved the human countenance,
let alone his beauty. But he has actually
retained his beauty ... and in all the Russian
people there is not one swindler or scoundrel
who does not know that he is mean and vile.”</p>

<p>Dostoievski further adds: “No! The Russian
people must not be judged by <em>what they are</em>,
but by <em>what they aspire to be</em>. The strong and
sacred ideals, which have been their salvation
from the age of suffering, are deeply
rooted in the Russian soul from the very beginning,
and these ideals have endowed this
soul for all time with simplicity and honesty,
with sincerity, and a broad, receptive good
sense,&mdash;all in perfect harmony.”</p>

<p>Concerning the part the Russian people are
destined to play in the world, Dostoievski wrote
the following:</p>

<p>“The Russian people is a strange phenomenon
in the history of mankind. Their character is
so different from that of the other peoples of
Europe that to this day Europeans have failed
to understand it, and misconstrue it at every turn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
All Europeans move towards the same goal.
But they differ in their fundamental interests,
which involve them in collisions and antagonisms,
whereby they are driven to go different ways.
The ideal of a universal humanity is steadily
fading from among them. The Russian people
possess a notable advantage over the other
European nations,&mdash;a remarkable peculiarity.
The Russians possess the synthetic faculty in
a high degree&mdash;the gift of feeling <em>at one</em> with
the universe and a universal humanity. <em>The
Russian has none of the European angularity, he
possesses the gift of discernment and of generosity
of soul.</em> He can adapt himself to anything and
he can <em>understand</em>. He has a feeling for all
that is human, <em>regardless of race</em>, <em>nationality</em> or
<em>fundamental ideas</em>. He finds and readily admits
reasonableness in all that contains even a vestige
of true human instinct. By this instinct he
can trace the human element in other nationalities
even in exceptional cases. He accepts
them at once, seeks to approximate them to his
own ideas, ‘places’ them in his own mind, and
often succeeds in finding a starting-point for
reconciling the conflicting ideas of two different
European nations.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>
<p>This characteristic is so general and so true,
that all other opinions on the character of a
great people must take second place. It finds
room for the Cossack with his nagaika and for
Tolstoi with his gospel. It embraces every
aspect of the human soul. Dostoievski himself
possessed the synthetic faculty, the wonderful
gift of universal understanding. He could make
it clear that a crime may be a holy deed, and
holiness mere prostitution, even as he succeeded
in fusing Russian Christianity with the Tatar
“Karat”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> in one soul. Whence came all these
paradoxes in the one man? On one occasion
he wrote: “I am struggling with my petty
creditors as <em>Laokoon wrestled with the serpents</em>.
I urgently require fifteen roubles. Only fifteen.
These fifteen roubles will give me relief, and I
shall be better able to work.” Here lies the
secret of the Russian synthesis in Dostoievski.
Mental work is restricted by hard external
circumstances. The inherent tendency to despond
when in trouble is one of the greatest
dangers to the Russian. He would fain lead
the contemplative life, and hesitates “to take
up arms against a sea of troubles.” To combat
this he has had to lash himself into a state of
hard practical efficiency. The Russian must
grow strong against himself before he can again
take up his ideal of an aggressive inner life.
It is once more a case of Laokoon and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
serpents. For this very reason Tolstoi’s teaching
did not appeal to Dostoievski. When he had
read a few sentences of this doctrine he clutched
his head and cried: “No, not that, anything
but that!” A few days later he was dead, and
the world will never know what was gathering
in his mind against the great heretic. But
Dostoievski’s works are really in themselves a
most vehement refutation of the Nazarene
doctrine&mdash;it is as if he had prophetically discerned
Tolstoi. Dostoievski solves the contrast
between European culture and Christianity in
accordance with both the Church and culture.
He bows before the miracle, the mystery, and
authority, and thus creates the union between
material culture and Christian culture. He accepts
the world as a whole, even as the Russian
people take it.</p>

<p>Tolstoi denies the divinity of Christ and the
entire synthesis of Russian philosophy. But
even Tolstoi could only have been born in Russia.
Personally he liked being accepted by the
Russian peasants as one of themselves. The
figure of the “Muzhik” is inseparable from
Tolstoi’s doctrine, because Tolstoi’s doctrine is
inseparable from the Russian people. It lives
in the Great Submerged, who are as far removed
from Western culture in fact as Tolstoi himself
is in theory. Russian law courts have to deal
every day with people who refuse to pay taxes,
to serve in the army, or to acknowledge the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
“pravoslav” clerical authority. The Church
calls these people “Shkoptzi,” “Molokami,” or
“Hlisti.” There are about twenty million of
them. They style themselves “White doves,”
“The New Israel,” “Doukhobortzi.” In principle
they are “pure Christians” like Tolstoi. Both
have the same “tone” of soul. Dostoievski
says of Tolstoi that he was one of those who fix
their eyes on one point, and cannot see what
happens to the right or to the left of that; and
if they <em>do</em> wish to see it they have to turn with
their whole body, as they invariably move
their <em>whole</em> soul also in one direction only. This
correctly observed obstinacy is the very opposite
to the synthetic gift and generosity of soul
mentioned before, and this peculiarity of the
Russian mind has often been called “Maximalism,”
to denote the rigid criterion, which
loves no happy mean, but always goes to the
utter extreme.</p>

<p>Many Western writers, among them the British
author Bering, have asserted that the Slavs have
no strength of will. This view is erroneous and
harmonizes neither with Tolstoi’s tendency to
extremes, nor with Dostoievski’s universal
charity. It applies only to such phenomena in
Slav life as are accessible to the European
tourist, as, for instance, technical undertakings
and colonial enterprise; for in this matter the
Slav is naturally not so well qualified as the
Englishman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<p>The Russian soul, and consequently the
character of the Russian people, is many-sided
and paradoxical in its obstinacy and its generosity.
It is the historical outcome of such extremes as
are represented by yellow positivist Mongolism,
and gentle altruistic Christianity. But the soul
of the Russian people has not yet clearly found
itself, like the souls of the Western nations;
first, because the head has not yet acquired
control over the body; secondly, because the
work of enlightenment and emancipation is
only being completed by the present war.
Hitherto it has laboured in its birth-throes. It
has been a Laokoon wrestling with serpents.</p>

<p class="indent f85">III. Csech Characteristics&mdash;Professor Masaryk&mdash;Jan
Huss&mdash;Slav Puritans&mdash;The Hradćin&mdash;Modern
Politics.</p>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Roughly</span> speaking the Group of the Northern
Slavs includes twenty million Poles and eight
million Csechs. Numerically, therefore, they are
the greatest of the unliberated Slav peoples.
Bohemia and her sister-country Moravia are
under Austrian rule, while Poland has been
dismembered and partitioned between Russia,
Germany and Austria. At one time both
countries were great and flourishing, and played
a prominent part in history. In 1526 the Csechs<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
acknowledged the Hapsburgs as their ruler,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> and
Bohemia’s political decay and gradual loss of
independence date both from this point. The
first partition of Poland in 1772 deprived the
Republic of liberty. Her dismemberment was
finally completed and sealed by the third partition
in 1795, and henceforth the Poles were even
deprived of the possibility of co-operating as
a nation.</p>

<p>The Csechs and Poles have both passed through
a national tragedy, but of the two the Polish
tragedy makes a stronger appeal to the imagination,
because of the contrast between their
former greatness and their present position, the
high level of their culture, and the lofty principles
at stake in the Great Polish Revolution. The
Poles fell victims to the foreign yoke just as their
civilization, their culture, and their <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit</em> were
on the fairway to rival the intellectual splendours
of France under Louis XIV. They were a
brilliant people&mdash;mentally and intellectually refined,
but physically decadent, and quite incapable
of surviving their political freedom. They yielded
to listless sentimentality and bewailed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
lost greatness instead of fighting to retrieve
it. You may love the Poles with your <em>heart</em>
but never with your reason! In this they are
the very antithesis to the Csechs whom you
cannot love except with your reason. You
may admire them for the culture they have so
laboriously won, but you cannot love them for it.</p>

<p>To the German and Austrian the Csech presents
a comic type. But no one looks upon the Pole
as comic; you hate him or you love him, but
you cannot ridicule him&mdash;there is something
great and tragic about him. The Russians who
hate him for <em>political</em> reasons are fired by religious
fanaticism. They hate the Jesuitical principles
of the Pole. The Germans hate the Polish
want of management, and “Polnische Wirtschaft”
(“Polish management”) is a German idiom.
But no one would insult Polish idealism and
the innate nobility of the Pole. He compares
with the Csech as Don Quixote with Sancho
Panza. He is a dreamer and visionary who
prostrates himself before an invisible shrine and
awaits the miracle of salvation and liberation.
This life of dreams has endowed the modern
Pole with hyper-sensitive nerves, dogmatic onesidedness,
and extreme passivity. Lost in the
contemplation of their royal past, the Polish people
wait in breathless silence for the first bird-note
to herald the dawn of freedom that shall dispel
the night of tribulation.</p>

<p>But, while the conscience of the nation lan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>guishes,
crucified in the bitter suffering of a
Messianic ideal, the Masses&mdash;the common people&mdash;are
sane and sturdy; they live and multiply
far removed from the griefs of the Classes. Their
hard life has made them dull and unfeeling;
caught in a world of factories, mines, and social
democracy, they are only interested in their
own immediate concerns and personal pleasures.
Anything beyond that they expect from the
mediation of “Bogarodjitza” (Mother of
God).</p>

<p>Wijspianski, a fine Polish dramatist, has strikingly
sketched the national character in one
single scene in his play “Wesele” (The Wedding).
The people are dancing their Polonaise and
Mazurka, with gay cockades and ribands on
their shoulders. The pretty bride leads off with
her herculean bridegroom. Suddenly Yasiek
rushes in upon the dancers and cries, “To arms!
rise and rebel, for Poland!” But the couples&mdash;as
if bewitched&mdash;continue to dance the <em>national</em>
measure. Yasiek, bitterly disappointed, sees his
hopes blighted and, choked with despair, he
sinks to the ground. But the couples go on
dancing, and he is <em>trampled to death</em> by the feet
of those whom he came to lead to freedom.
This scene epitomises the position of affairs in
modern Poland&mdash;the despair of the great lord
with his pedigree, broad acres, and capital, who
has absolutely no hold over the plain people
because they have turned away from him. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
have lost their rights, their land and their traditions;
the only link between the two is the
Catholic ideal, the ideal of <em>Polish</em> Catholicism,
which is hallowed in the image of Our Lady of
Csenstochova, whose brow is encircled with the
crown of the ancient Queens of Poland.</p>

<p>The younger generation in Poland has realized
that this link between the Classes and Masses
must rest on a surer foundation.</p>

<p>Between the aristocracy and the masses has
arisen the class of the <em>educated poor</em>. These
people are mainly of Russian descent, but the
sons of Polish Jews form an important proportion
and have acquired considerable influence, chiefly
in the journalistic world. This young Poland
saw itself confronted by a great vanished Polish
age of romanticists and poets, with pronounced
aristocratic and Catholic sentiments. The whole
intellectual struggle of the modern democratic
generation consists in an attempt to find contact
with this past. Science also is endeavouring to
reconcile the spirit of the present with the spirit of
the past, and hopes to prepare the future development
of an individualistic Polish culture on this
foundation.</p>

<p>The contrast between German and Polish
culture is the contrast between the culture of the
masses and the culture of the individual. The
principal social feature in mediæval Germany was
<em>feudalism</em>. Germany was ruled by a number of
feudal <em>princes</em>, Poland by a number of aristocratic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
<em>families</em>. But this <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</em> proved disastrous to
Poland. A state where individuals rule by
mutual consent is bound to develop differently
from one where families rule without any mutual
consent. In the expansive Western monarchies
the power of the State increased, while the
aristocratic republic of Poland steadily declined.
The main reason for this difference probably lies
in the geographical position of Poland. It lay
too far from the West&mdash;too far from Rome and
its culture.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<p>The province of Galicia, which fell to Austria’s
share by the partition of Poland, undoubtedly
fared better than the rest of the country. It is
inhabited by 4,252,483 Poles and 3,381,570
Ruthenes (including Bukovina). As geographical
and racial neighbours of the Csechs, who were
already displaying the greatest determination in
their national struggle, the great population bade
fair to become a danger to Austrian policy.
Vienna was quick to realize this, and arranged
her tactics towards the Poles accordingly. As
soon as the Russian and German Poles began to
be down-trodden, it was an easy matter to dispose
of any separatist tendency among the Austrian
Poles by reminding them of the position of their
brothers. At home the Government began by
fomenting the national discord between the Poles
and the Ruthenes. It neglected the latter in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
favour of the Poles, and absolutely disregarded
their reasonable claims. The Poles were not only
granted great national and political concessions;
they became the Slav favourite of the Viennese
ministry. Not only were they represented by
their own “<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Landmannsminister</em>” (“the Secretary
for Galicia,” so to say), but one other important
portfolio (usually that of Finance) was always
entrusted to a Pole.</p>

<p>The Poles were quite content with this position
and supported Austrian policy accordingly. As
this policy is above all things anti-Slav, this
meant that the most chivalrous of all the Slav
nations became a tool in the hands of Slavdom’s
chief oppressor. This was partly due to the fact
that this staunchly Catholic people is surrounded
by non-Catholic enemies&mdash;by Protestant Germans
on the one hand and Orthodox Russians on the
other. Moreover, they look upon Catholicism as
the one safe harbor&mdash;hence their attachment to
Roman Catholic Austria. Here also lies the clue
to Polish views, their sympathies and antipathies.
But there is no justification for this position.
Catholicism is not a Slav national religion, and
can never become part of the soul of a Slav
people. Strictly speaking, it is responsible for
the decline of part of the Slav race. <em>All</em> Catholic
Slav countries up to date have been in captivity,
whereas <em>all</em> such Slavs as have retained their
national orthodox religion are <em>free</em>. It is quite
natural that the Poles should cling to Catholicism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
as an acquired religion which appeals to them,
but they should not have used it as a national
and traditional basis for their attitude towards the
rest of the Slavs. It is a mistake which has done
little good to their own national aspirations,
and incalculable harm to the Slav cause.</p>

<p>In many Slav circles there is a tendency to
ascribe this attitude of the Poles, not to their Messianic
ideal, but to a purely individual egotism.
This view is at least partially true, were it only
because Polish politics are not the politics of
the nation, but of the ruling class. The Polish
aristocracy, who were unable to forget their
past glories, saw in the feudal and aristocratic
principles of the Austrian Government a possibility
of retaining their position in the Dual
Monarchy. They made full use of their opportunities
even while (in theory) they were careful
to guard Polish national interests. This aristocracy
had no feeling for the common Slav cause,
and whenever they had a chance of authority
(Goluchowski, Bilinski) they have proved themselves
a positive danger to the cause. That
this aristocracy has cast its spell over the greater
part of the educated classes and formed political
parties as it chose is due to the inherent moral
dependence of the Pole upon his aristocracy;&mdash;snobbery
is as much a disease with him as
Roman Catholicism. Not however among the
common people are they always the heedless
dancers of Wijspianski’s drama. They allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
everything to pass <em>over</em> them, and only trample
upon that which happens to lie beneath their
feet. Moreover, their inmost soul is rich in the
true Slav qualities; but this wealth is hidden
as in a fast-locked casket, and there it will lie
until the radiant smile of the “Mother of
God” of Csenstochova shall miraculously reveal
it.</p>

<p>For a long time Polish politics have disturbed
the Slav balance in the Dual Monarchy. The
Austro-Hungarian monarchy is properly a Slav
State in the fullest sense of the word. According
to official statistics 22,821,864 out of 51,351,531
souls are Slavs. The ruling races, Germans
and Hungarians, number 21,259,644 between
them, and the remainder are accounted for by
Roumanians, Italians and other nationalities. It
must be pointed out that Slavs living in Hungary
(especially in Baczka and in the Banat) are&mdash;much
against their will&mdash;simply entered in the
census as Hungarians, and that in like manner
hundreds of thousands of Slavs in Bohemia,
Carinthia, Styria and Carniola are put down as
Germans. Protests against these proceedings
pass unheeded, and Slav National Census Unions
were formed to check the Governmental statistics;
according to these more than 50 per cent.
of the entire population are Slavs. This percentage
is proportionately increased if we further
include the Slav emigrants in Australia and
America. These number about five million, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
would doubtless return to their homes if more
tolerable conditions could be procured.</p>

<p>And yet this Monarchy aspires to be anything
but a Slav State. German and Magyar rule has
sought to swamp the Slav element in every
possible way. Following Metternich’s principle
“<em>divide et impera</em>” the Slavs were divided into
two “spheres.” The Northern Slavs were handed
over to Austrian autocracy, and the Southern
Slavs to Magyar plutocracy. Thus it came to pass
that <em>9 million Germans</em> rule <em>15 million Slavs</em>,
and 10 million Magyars, Jews, or spurious Magyars
rule 7-1/2 million Slavs.</p>

<p>Even if theoretically the balance of power
seems more rational in the Hungarian sphere,
in the Austrian it is plainly absurdly disproportionate.
And here the Poles were the straw
in the balance which decided in favour of German
hegemony. If the Poles had recognized their
duty to their own race the Slav question would
long ago have been on a better footing. A just
understanding with the Ruthenes and a joint
national struggle with the Csechs would certainly
have broken German supremacy, or forced
it to accord more tolerable conditions to all
the Slavs. But the Galician Poles have never
done anything for the Slav cause in the Monarchy,
but rather sought to curry favour with the
Government in Vienna, and, by repudiating
their kinship, to obtain concessions for their
own negative national ideals, and for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
intellectual and economic development. Austria
had no objection to this platonic nationalism so
long as the Poles by their pro-German policy
supported her in oppressing the other Slavs.</p>

<p>The Csechs and Ruthenes have been specially
handicapped in their national struggle by the
attitude of the Poles. And the result was
an implacable enmity between the Poles and the
Ruthenes, which was, if anything, encouraged by
the Government. In this struggle the Ruthenes
undoubtedly fared the worse. They are in a
national minority in Galicia, and unmercifully
oppressed by the Poles, who hate them all the
more for being the descendants of the hated Russians
(Little Russians) and because they refused
to conceal their sympathy with Russia. The
Ruthenes fought hard for the right to speak
their own tongue and have their own school
system. But the Poles were ruthlessly opposed
to these demands, which were in consequence also
denied by the Government. The struggle finally
degenerated into wholesale denunciations of the
Ruthenes by the Poles, who accused their enemies
of high treason and conspiracy with Russia.</p>

<p>It must, however, be admitted that even among
the Poles there were many who deeply deplored
this fratricidal struggle, and did their utmost to
induce the Northern Slavs of the Monarchy to
combine in the common cause. Time and
again the Csech patriots urged the desirability
of a union, and, as similar appeals came from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
other Slav countries also, the realization of a
true <em>Pan-Slav</em> and <em>democratic</em> ideal often seemed
imminent. The spectre of <em>Pan-Germanism</em>, waiting
like some ravenous monster to devour the
Slav nations limb by limb, appeared even to
the Poles, but unscrupulous politicians, bureaucratic
upstarts, and slippery diplomats from
Vienna conjured up the bogey of <em>Russification</em>
to alarm them, and all patriotic efforts were in
vain.</p>

<p>Still it is psychologically interesting that a
Slav race through fear of Russification should
have thrown itself into the arms of&mdash;Germanism.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>The favoured position of the Poles in Austria
contrasts sharply with that of their brothers in
Russia and Germany. They were oppressed in
every way;&mdash;Russian <em>official</em> policy towards the
Poles bears all the stamp of autocratic tyranny.
Their political rights are restricted to a minimum,
and as regards civil rights they are nearly as
badly off as the Russian Jews. Still it is characteristic
that the reason for this oppression lay,
not in the national, but in the religious element.
Roman Catholicism, which was an advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
to the Austrian, proved a misfortune to the
Russian Poles. For the Russian looks upon
Catholicism as the very antithesis to his conception
of the Slav ideal. Pravo-Slav Russia,
with her ancient, wondrously pure Slavo-religious
traditions, and all the warmth of her faith, could
not take kindly to the haughty, frigidly cold
Catholic Poles. The great political power of
the Holy Synod, the supreme (unfortunately
too clerical) representative body of this faith,
exercised an influence adverse to the Polish
people, and the Russian Government, which only
too often has been the mere executive of the
will of the Holy Synod, established an autocratic
<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</em> with far-reaching national and personal
restrictions. The first result of this policy was
unmitigated hatred on the part of the Poles,
and a craving for vengeance and freedom. The
Russian Poles intrigued with their Austrian
brothers, and envied them their favoured position.
But the only support the Austrian Poles vouchsafed
their brothers was that they applied the
Russian methods of oppression to the Ruthenes.</p>

<p>Whoever knows anything of Russia’s repressive
measures, will realize that the Poles were in a
hard case. Owing to the passive character
of the Poles their struggles were never sufficiently
organized to assume the proportions of
a well organized revolution. But oppression has
strengthened their national self-reliance, their
ideals have burned more brightly, and a longing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
for freedom has entirely dominated them. Still,
even now, they are far more inclined to wait
for the miracle than to bestir themselves on
their own behalf; and if in recent years their
position has somewhat improved, it is not so
much due to their own efforts as to the wave of
modern thought among the Russians themselves.</p>

<p>The <em>Russian Governmental</em> policy made no
distinction between the Poles and her Russian
subjects who were thirsting for social regeneration.
So the Russians discovered for themselves
that they had to seek the friendship and collaboration
of the Poles. The wide horizon of the
modern Russian movement will not permit the
exclusion of a single capable member of the
Tsar’s great realm from the benefits of the future.
Not only the Russian people, but the whole
of Russia had to be won over to the cause of the
great ideal. The regeneration of Russia was to
herald the regeneration of the whole of the Slav
race, and the Poles as Slavs had a right to help in
this work. The Russians have always said that
they are very fond of the Poles, but that they
are not sufficiently <em>Slav</em>&mdash;they ought to be
Slavicized. The Russian Government sought to
accomplish this by violence, whereas the <em>Russian
people</em>, represented by the Russian revolutionaries,
chose the better path of mutual understanding
and respect. Of course, the official policy of the
Holy Synod is still in force, and although the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
constitutional manifesto and the Duma have
brought about certain changes, these are at
present quite unimportant. The Poles, however,
are winning an increasing number of friends and
advocates among the Russians, who are pleading
for equal rights and a constitution for Poland.
Moreover, the times have changed, and when
Russia was confronted by the present great
European crisis the Poles displayed a marvellous
loyalty, which has, perhaps, unintentionally
brought them nearer the realization of their
dreams than they have ever been before. The
Manifesto of the Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaievitch
is the greatest event in Polish history
since the partition.</p>

<p>The hardest lot of all has befallen those Poles
who have been most loyal to their race. I
mean those who came under Prussian rule.
For whereas Polish Slavdom is tolerated in
Austria, and actually encouraged in Russia, in
Prussia it is remorselessly ground down under
the iron heel of Germanism. Germanization is
carried out by Prussian rule, aggressively, in a
strictly military sense. It is not a question of
political tactics&mdash;no opinion at home or abroad
is considered; there is nothing but frank coercion.
Germany’s ambitions are only too well known&mdash;they
have been advertised loudly enough, and
they have been expounded again quite recently
in General von Bernhardi’s notorious book,
“Germany and the Next War”&mdash;a book written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
with all the brusque insolence of which only a
German is capable. If Germany’s future programme
includes the Germanizing of the whole
of Europe, it is surely superfluous to relate in
detail how she strove to Germanize a people
under her own rule&mdash;it is one of the blackest
chapters in the histories of oppression.</p>

<p>By the constitution of Germany the Prussian
Poles cannot forfeit their rights as citizens of
the realm. This circumstance afforded them a
chance of laying their grievances before the
legislative assemblies. But in spite of their
gallant courage, the struggle brought them no
particular advantage except the moral satisfaction
of knowing that their pleading could
reach the ear of Europe. But whenever their
voice grew too loud, the mailed fist fell on their
lips and struck them dumb. When the German
Reichstag passed the Polish Expropriation Law
(1886)<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> all Europe was scandalized; but from
the point of view of Germanization it was highly
successful. Germany disregarded foreign opinion
and the law was put in force.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that the conclusion of the
present European war will also put an end to
the sufferings of these martyrs, and that the
whole Polish nation will be granted an opportunity
of applying its many admirable qualities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
for its own welfare and for the union of the Slav
race.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p>The Csechs have always been a strong, tenacious,
energetic people, and no sooner did they
begin to feel the iron fist of their oppressors than
they opened a determined campaign against them
and pitted their strength against their tyrants.
They have won their present civilization inch
by inch from their oppressors.</p>

<p>The eminent Csech political economist, Professor
Masaryk, admirably forecasts the future
of his people. He says&mdash;“The humanistic ideal,
the ideal of regeneration, bears a deep national
and historical significance for us Csechs. A
full and sincere grasp of the human ideal will
bridge over the spiritual and ethical dreams of
centuries, and enable us to advance with the
vanguard of human progress. The Csech humanitarian
ideal is no romantic fallacy. Without
work and effort the humanitarian ideal is but
dead; it demands that we shall everywhere
and systematically oppose ourselves to all that
is bad, to all social <em>un</em>humanity&mdash;both at home
and abroad&mdash;with all its clerical, political and
national organs. The humanitarian ideal is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
not sentimentality&mdash;it means work, work, and
yet again work!”</p>

<p>Now all this is by no means a characteristic of
the Csech people, but only a forecast of what
they shall be. Political tactics must always
correspond to the principles of decency and
humanity. Masaryk further says&mdash;“Our fame,
our wars, and our intervention in the past have
borne a religious, not a national stamp. Our
<em>national</em> ideal is of more recent birth&mdash;it only
belongs to the last, and more especially to the
present century. The history of Bohemia must
not be judged from this standpoint.”</p>

<p>Perhaps this programme will prove too historical
and too unpractical for the present day.
The small commercial and industrial Csech
nation is too far removed from the age of Jan
Huss, and the Csech reformation has lost its
significance for them. But deep down in the
soul of the Csech people there still dwells a spark
of the Hussite spirit. Of course, the battle-cry
is nationalist, the phrasing that of the twentieth
century, but the underlying spirit differs in no
way from the righteous indignation of Huss, when
he preached against high-handed oppression and
violence. The physical inferior is never anxious
to see his affairs settled by physical force. For
this reason it is not a matter of indifference to
the Csechs, whether they fight for a higher principle
or merely for material advantage. At
present they are principally fighting for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
language, for the right to speak their own
tongue&mdash;they are fighting against Germanization.
Their strongest weapon in this fight is their
striving for economic prosperity&mdash;a physical
power through which they may hope to obtain
a spiritual victory.</p>

<p>The principal trait in the Csech character
is <em>initiative</em>. The very name points to this,
for “Csech” is derived from the old-Slav
word “Chenti,” meaning “to will” or “to
begin.”</p>

<p>History finds the Csechs in the vanguard of all
the Slav tribes in their wanderings westward.
Their legendary leader was Csech, one of three
brothers, and his tribe penetrated the farthest.
In the Middle Ages the Csechs were the first
to challenge the power of Rome, and to this day
they send numbers of enterprising emigrants to
all parts of the world. But the Csechs have
one great fault&mdash;they are fickle. Their enthusiasm
flashes up quickly and then as quickly dies
down. This is the reason of the failure of the
Hussite Reformation. The Germans finished what
the Csechs began&mdash;Luther was the successor of
Huss and completed his work.</p>

<p>The Csechs are not by nature a commercial
and industrial people. Their business capacity
is born of necessity&mdash;it is a weapon, not a means
of gain. It is kept going by an unwearied
agitation on the part of the national leaders, and
if the Csech national ideal should suffer ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>wreck,
then Csech finance, ambition, and industry
will likewise perish.</p>

<p>Sundry Slavophil thinkers would exclude the
Csechs from the group of Slav peoples, just because
of their initiative and business capacity. The
Russian ethnologist Danilevski calls the Csech
people a monstrosity, a German people with a
Slav tongue. But these men have overlooked the
fact that the foundation of modern Csech prosperity
was laid by the religion of the Csech
Brethren. During the Catholic reaction the
Csech Protestants were driven from their possessions
and treated as aliens in their own country.
Being thus compelled to evolve a new means of
gaining a livelihood, they turned to industry.
Trade and the towns were closed to them, and
the Csech Brethren had to seek refuge in the
Bohemian and Moravian hills, and the Orlic
mountains. They became weavers, wood-carvers
and miners, and laid the foundation of the great
modern Bohemian textile, glass and earthenware
industries. Religious considerations and nothing
else have made the Csechs into a mercantile
nation. England’s wealth also springs from a
religious movement&mdash;the rise of Puritanism.
Thrift and industry led to the accumulation of
capital. Only a religious man understands
work and thrift, and he alone knows how to
utilise capital as a moral lever. For this
reason it would be wrong to adopt the views
of the Russian ethnologist. The Csech people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
<em>as they are</em> have a right to their future and to
freedom.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<p>In the centre of Prague, on the summit of the
Hradčin, stands the old Csech Royal Castle, a
splendid monument of past greatness. Proud
and lofty, visible from afar, it speaks to the Csech
people of the days when it sheltered&mdash;not the
foreign invader, but flesh of their flesh, Csech
kings and princes of their own blood. And even
as it is a monument of the past, it is also a beacon
for the present and the future. When the setting
sun sheds his crimson glory upon Castle
and Hradčin, it seems as though the very stones
were aglow with the reflection of all the Csech
blood that has been shed in the defence of right
and liberty. But&mdash;the royal splendour vanishes
with the sun, and the shadow of night descends
on Castle and height like a symbol of the present
age of gloom. Day by day, with burning eyes,
the Csech reads the wordless message. Yet he
does not give way to dreams, or sink into deep
melancholy, nor does he wait for a miracle. He
clenches his fist and smiles the grim smile of the
tireless warrior. His fickleness at the time of
the Reformation weighs like a sin on his conscience,
but its ideals have set their mark upon him
and quickened the seed of <em>political</em> reformation in
his soul. In this matter the Csechs take the
lead among all the Slavs in Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that in certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Slav circles the Csechs are looked upon as Germans
with a Slav tongue. But, if their industrial
and mercantile prosperity and certain
individual characteristics lend some colour to
this view, it is quite refuted by the Csech activity
in the Slav national and political cause. In their
sturdy and <em>progressive</em> struggle against Germanization
the Csechs have set the other Austrian
Slavs a tactical and practical example as to
how the struggle should be fought&mdash;<em>tactically</em> on
constitutional lines, and, <em>practically</em>, with indomitable
courage and perseverance.</p>

<p>In spite of their long subjection to an absolute
autocracy, the Csechs developed into so strong
a political factor, that even Vienna began to
fear the weight of their hand. They achieved
this not only from a sense of self-preservation or
separatist selfishness like the Poles, but the Slav
ideal runs like a gold thread through all they
have done; it is their motto, task and goal.
They were beset from three sides, by the Austrian
Germans in all their power, by Polish opposition,
and by Magyar agitations and hostile influences
in Vienna. The Southern Slav deputies in the
Reichstag were their only helpers in the unequal
struggle. But they never relaxed their energy
and they never yielded a position they had won.</p>

<p>The national struggle in Bohemia took on its
present form in the first half of the nineteenth
century, and it first centred round “cultural”
interests as in other Slav countries. The love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
of the people for their own language had to be
established and even rekindled to a pitch of
fiery enthusiasm, and national education had
also to be fostered by the foundation of Csech
national schools. The State was by no means
anxious to enlighten the people, and the number
of schools maintained in the country was quite
inadequate. The fiscal schools were all German
and served to spread the German propaganda.
But the Csech educated classes founded schools
at their own expense, as well as the “Matica
Školska” (School Union), which undertook the
organization of these schools. This was an
effective counter-stroke to Germanization as well
as a good foundation for further success. Palacky,
Kollar and Havliček were leaders of the National
movement of the time.</p>

<p>Palacky was the source from whom the others
drew their inspiration. He was a great thinker,
a brilliant author, and a cautious, liberal-minded
politician who may be considered the founder
of modern Csech national life. And through
him radiated the light that pointed the way
which these people must take. Kollar, the poet
and publicist, and Havliček, as politician and
political economist, shared the Csech leadership
with Palacky, and paved the way for a great
national intellectual movement which kept pace
with the national political movement. They
founded a strong nationalist party in Bohemia
(The Old Csechs) in opposition to the Viennese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Government. With their majority in the Landtag,
and their appearance in the Viennese Parliament,
the Csech people became a factor with
whom the Government had to reckon for good
or for evil&mdash;a people who refused to be ousted.
Bohemia, which official Austria loves to consider
a German country, had to be divided into
“spheres.” The State had to pay for the
upkeep of Csech schools and the administration
became bi-lingual! Of course, in accordance
with the usual Government policy, many Csech
localities were included in German spheres and
promptly became bones of contention. The
“Matica Školska” founded more schools in these
spheres to prevent the Germanization of Csech
children, whilst the German schools pursued their
system of an unofficial propaganda with the tacit
support of the Government. This state of affairs
led to constant disturbances, which frequently
degenerated into riot and bloodshed. With the
rise of the “Young Csechs” the struggle assumed
a more drastic and determined character, for
this party aimed at nothing less than a purely
Csech government for Bohemia, and a proportionate
share in the management of Imperial
affairs. They repeatedly succeeded in wrecking
the Austrian Government, and under Prince
Hohenlohe they were so strongly represented
in the Cabinet that they succeeded in making
their power felt. The “Young Csechs” have
greatly helped the national cause in Bohemia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
and also furthered the Slav cause by their
enthusiastic championship of the All-Slav Ideal.</p>

<p>One of their leaders, Dr. Kramarz, who was
very friendly with Russia, has been specially
active in this cause. Though the “Young Csechs”
are still the leading party, recent years have seen the
rise of parties even more radical in their demands.
The Social-Nationals and the Csech Radicals desire
to see Bohemia an absolutely autonomous State,
whereas the followers of Professor Masaryk
aim at the regeneration of the Csech race on a
different basis (see opening of this article).</p>

<p>Events have moved rapidly in Bohemia since
the last Balkan war, which made a profound
impression on all the Austrian Slavs. Owing
to the uncompromising attitude taken up by
the various parties, the Government dissolved
the Bohemian Landtag, suspended the constitution
and placed the administration in the hands
of a Commission appointed by the Government
and responsible to none. The Csechs retorted by
a violent obstruction in the Viennese Parliament
and so paralyzed the House, that it had to be
prorogued indefinitely. The Csechs demanded
the immediate convocation of the Landtag.
“No Landtag, no Austrian Parliament,” was
their watchword, and they stood firm. When
the crisis with Serbia and the outbreak of the war
occurred, the Parliament was unable to adopt any
attitude towards these events, and the only
<em>constitutional body</em> in the Monarchy able to deal
with them was the Hungarian Parliament.</p>

<small>BULGARIA.</small></h3>

<p class="indent f85">Country and People&mdash;The building up of the Bulgarian
State&mdash;Relations with Russia&mdash;German Influence&mdash;Alexander
of Battenberg&mdash;King Ferdinand&mdash;Bulgaria’s
Immediate Duty.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Although</span> it is asserted on historical grounds
that the Bulgarians are a mixed race, and merely
“Slavicized” by the influence of neighbouring
Slav races, they certainly ought to be included
in the great Slav family. In many ways they
have always held aloof from the Slav Ideal, and
emphatically preferred to stand alone, but,
nevertheless, they have done great service to the
Slav cause in the past, and often fought for it
with true enthusiasm. In the early days of
Christianity the Bulgarians also did much for
Slav culture through the Bogumili&mdash;(a sect of
reformers which will be dealt with in the Chapter
on the Southern Slavs)&mdash;who spread religious
enlightenment, and through the old Bulgarian
tongue laid the foundation of the other Slav
languages. The Bulgarians, who were once
masters of a great Empire, and enjoyed worldwide
importance under Simeon the Great, had<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
to share the age-long tragedy of all the Eastern
Slavs, and it speaks volumes for their national
character that they emerged from Turkish
bondage as a strong, self-reliant people. Whoever
knows the Bulgarians well, cannot fail to
respect them, even if they do not inspire great
affection. I believe as a race they are not affectionate&mdash;they
prefer to command respect. The
gentle, dreamy, love-craving element in the
character of the other Slavs is quite absent in
them, and even their fire and enthusiasm is not
a matter of sentiment, but a practical necessity&mdash;almost
a matter of mathematical calculation.
Industrious and thrifty as no other Slav nation,
cold-blooded and calculating, they have justly
been called the “Slav Japanese.” Their type
is very interesting and differs considerably from
that of the other Slavs. Almost without exception
the men are handsome and strongly built,
whereas the appearance of the women is spoilt
by their wide cheek-bones and thick-set build.
Like most of the Slav peoples they are mainly
farmers and cattle-breeders, and as the country
is fertile, they make quite a good income out of
their exports of grain, field-produce and cattle.</p>

<p>Although Bulgarian intellectual life springs
from the people, and the Bulgarians are essentially
a democratic nation, it is necessary to
distinguish between the educated classes and the
common people. The Bulgarian peasant is an
exceedingly good fellow; physically very active,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
mentally rather stolid, he pursues his calling in
a calm deliberate way, and is not easily ruffled.
His food is most simple; he takes practically no
alcohol and, owing to his temperate mode of life,
lives to a very great age. The entire population
numbers about four millions and shows a greater
percentage of centenarians than any other nation.
The Bulgarians are very fond of music and
dancing, but they have no music or poetry of
their own, and what they do possess has been
borrowed from the Turks or other Orientals.
The traveller may often come upon the genuine
Nautch dance in a Bulgarian village, and will hear
songs sung to purely Turkish melodies. If the
Bulgarians have any advantage over the other
Slavs, it is in the beauty of their unadulterated
Orthodox faith. The people are narrowly
religious, and up to now their religion represents
the zenith of their culture. In this respect they
resemble the Russians and all the Slavs who
have retained the Slavo-Orthodox faith. It is
superfluous to enlarge on the fighting qualities
of the Bulgarians&mdash;Kirkilisse, Lule Burgas, and
Adrianople have given ample proof of these.</p>

<p>The educated classes are distinct from the
people in two ways: they are free-thinkers and
quarrelsome. Religion is cultivated among them
as a fashion, and the churches have become mere
rendezvous, as in Paris, Berlin and Vienna. But,
in spite of all this, one must admit that the
educated classes of Bulgaria are excellent social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
organizers, though politically and intellectually
they are not particularly brilliant. The amount
achieved in social matters by these men in the
short time that has elapsed since the emancipation
is marvellous. Bulgaria in this respect has
become a truly modern state. This bright side
is, however, eclipsed by the countless blunders
they have committed in other respects. The
worst of these is their headstrong blindness in
the political administration. Bulgarian politics
have degenerated into a devastating party-system,
and are largely responsible for the tragical happenings
of recent years, in which the whole
country, and more especially the innocent mass
of the people have been involved. The chief
characteristic of the educated Bulgarian is his
distrust of everyone; he does not confine this
distrust to strangers, but extends it even to his
King and his own party leader.</p>

<p>Hitherto intellectual Bulgaria has created but
little, and that little is quite out of proportion
to the achievements of some other much smaller
Slav nations. Bulgarian art and literature are
merely poor reproductions of foreign originals
and by no means express the strength and
vitality of the people. Of all their poets Ivan
Vasoff, Hristoff, and Aleko Konstantinoff alone
have understood anything of the soul of the people,
and only their work will live. In art we seek in
vain for anything purely Bulgarian. But there
is one thing of the greatest value that the educated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Bulgarians have done for their nation, and for this
they deserve a true crown of laurels. I am referring
to the organization of the Macedonian bands
during the last half-century. Their perseverance
and heroism call for the greatest admiration.</p>

<p>The country owned by the Bulgarians is one
of the most beautiful inhabited by Slavs. Only
Dalmatia and Bosnia can compare with it, and
whoever has once been there will never forget
it. It is the land of the great Balkans in all
their wild beauty&mdash;the land of the Kazanlik
Valley with its vast glorious rose-fields; the
Vratza Gorge with its romantic cliffs, dark
primeval forests, and hills covered with lilac; the
Black Sea, and the beautiful shores of Varna
and Burgas, and above all tower the snow-capped
summits of the Vitosha. Everywhere,
and in everything, dwells a throbbing life, full of
variety and contrast, beautiful as the men of
Bulgaria and rugged as their women.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<p>Bulgaria was freed from the Turkish yoke in
1878. The work of emancipation was carried
out by Russia with the help of Bulgarian bands
and many volunteers from all the Slav countries.
By the peace of San Stefano Bulgaria was
<em>de jure</em> declared mistress of the entire territories
from the Black Sea to Silistria, and along the
Danube as far as Vidin in the north, from Vidin
along the Morava <em>via</em> Ochrida as far as Yanina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
in the west, from Yanina <em>via</em> Salonika to Kavala
in the south, and in a straight line from Kavala
to Varna in the east. <em>De facto</em> she was only
given independent jurisdiction over such territories
as she possessed up to the first Balkan
war. The complete liberation of Bulgaria was
by no means achieved by the emancipation, and
she continued to remain under Turkish suzerainty.</p>

<p>The first task after the emancipation was to
reconstruct the country on the lines of a modern
European state, and to infuse new life into it
after so many centuries of Turkish misrule.
Education was represented solely by the priests
and the schoolmasters, who had laboured for
the enlightenment of the people even before the
emancipation. Of course, there were a few
Bulgarians who possessed a European education,
and had graduated at European universities,
and upon these devolved the task of solving
the problems of the newly-created state. There
were however so few of them that, at the beginning,
many men of culture were imported from
other Slav countries, chiefly from Russia, Croatia
and Bohemia. The military administration was
entrusted to Russia, who established garrisons
of her own in Bulgaria and undertook to create
the Bulgarian army. Considering the transitionary
stage of the country at the time, it
was inevitable that the Russian military authorities
should obtain considerable influence over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
civil administration also, and that Bulgarian
affairs fell under Russian influence from the
very beginning.</p>

<p>Prince Alexander of Battenberg, the first
Bulgarian ruler, came to the throne under
similar conditions as King Carol to the throne
of Roumania. He was confronted with a super-human
task, and Bulgarian history can never
deny the great service he rendered the country.
He came with a definite mission and set to work
with the greatest possible zeal. He devoted
his attention chiefly to the education of the
people and to the army, and he found his most
energetic ally in the people themselves. The
prompt efficiency of the school system would
have done credit to many a more modern state.
The Bulgarians are intelligent, persevering, and
fond of learning, and popular education made
immense strides. At the present day the percentage
of adult Bulgarians who cannot read
and write is exceedingly small compared to most
other countries&mdash;it is 2-1/2 per cent. of the adult
population. The national system of compulsory
education affected the very poorest peasants as
well as the better classes. Before the foundation
of secondary schools in the country large numbers
of young men were sent to foreign secondary
schools and universities, and every year yielded
its quota of well-equipped youths capable of
providing the motive power for the machinery
of the State. Similar purposeful energy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
characterized the military organization, with the
intention of forming an independent, purely
Bulgarian army. For, in spite of his great
admiration for Russia and the Tsar Liberator,
Prince Alexander felt that dependence upon
Russia&mdash;more especially a military dependence&mdash;would
render his country a vassal <em>de facto</em> of
Russia, no less than it was <em>de jure</em> already the
vassal of Turkey. He therefore strove to render
the Russian military administration superfluous
in Bulgaria by building up an efficient home army.</p>

<p>As soon as this was accomplished he sent a
letter of thanks to the Tsar, made a public
manifesto, gave a big dinner to the Russian
generals, and gratefully dismissed the Russian
co-operation. Then the Russian generals had to
leave Bulgaria. No one can deny that Prince
Alexander showed himself manly and self-reliant
in taking this decision, which was prompted by
a very proper ambition. But he gave mortal
offence in Russia, and from that moment he
fell completely from Russian favour. The Court
circles in St. Petersburg, which had been hostile
to him from the beginning, now began to intrigue
against him in Bulgaria, their efforts finding
a ready response in the pro-Russian party.
The first Serbian War in 1885 afforded splendid
proof of Alexander’s military organization, but
his influence was too far undermined, and even
his victories failed to save him. The tide of
adverse circumstances was too strong and led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
to the inevitable but, fortunately, bloodless
<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’état</em> in 1886. Prince Alexander was taken
from his palace by night, transported over the
frontier and formally deposed.</p>

<p>Prince Alexander left Bulgaria a well-organized
State, only disturbed by internal party hatreds.
The new ruler, Prince Ferdinand of Coburg,
was received with divided sympathies. Already
in many ways his path had been smoothed
for him, but he met with far more opposition
from his own people than his predecessor, whom
Russia had installed. In spite of all this, the
machinery of State continued in the path of progress,
the constitution of the country was established
on a broad liberal basis, and the army
increased in importance from year to year.
With iron perseverance Bulgaria steadily advanced
to take her place among modern states,
and even succeeded in taking the lead in the
Balkan question. The proclamation of Ferdinand
as King of Bulgaria put an end once and for
all to the shadow of Turkish suzerainty, and since
then Bulgaria has been frankly acknowledged
as a strong, free and independent State.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<p>In the course of years Bulgarian relations
with Russia have passed through many phases,
especially during the reign of King Ferdinand.
As a rule the will of Russia was decisive, but
her general influence always depended on home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
politics and varied with the party in power.
Enthusiasm for Russia and antagonism against
Russian influence were alternately the order of
the day. Only the people of Bulgaria remained
constant in their confidence and affection for
Russia; they could never forget whose hand had
set them free, and even political changes could
not shake them. Certain political circles took
the emancipation from Russia as their party
cry and hoped to make the country great <em>outside</em>
the Russian protectorate. They desired to translate
their motto “Bulgaria for the Bulgarians”
into an absolute fact. This party was founded
by the notorious Stambuloff, and whenever
they came into power they insisted on regarding
not only Russia as the national enemy, but
also the Bulgarian <em>people</em> who were in sympathy
with Russia, and they did their utmost to
tyrannize the people out of this “disease.”
In fighting for this idea they coined the party
catchword&mdash;“Greater Bulgaria” in the hope
of bribing the people by promises of Macedonia,
Serbia, Greece, and even Constantinople as
future tit-bits. This particular party knew very
well that Russia would never allow the Slav
equilibrium in the Balkans to be upset, and, as it
was not over Slavonic in its sympathies, it waged
a bitter opposition against the Russian protectorate,
under which all the Balkan Slav
nations stand to benefit equally. In opposition
to Stambuloff’s party there arose another, founded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
by Karaveloff, the greatest of Bulgarian patriots,
who fought with all the enthusiasm of which
grateful hearts are capable. Karaveloff saw
clearly that Bulgaria would be too weak to
stand alone for a very long time to come, and that
the Russian protectorate was a strong guarantee
against foreign hostile influence. After Karaveloff’s
death his ideas found enthusiastic partisans
in Czankoff, Radoslavoff and Daneff in spite of
minor tactical party differences. Stambuloff’s
violent death&mdash;he was assassinated in the open
street&mdash;put an end to the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</em> of his party for
many years, and brought the moderate pro-Russian
parties into power. But Bulgaria was
deeply injured by his policy. He bequeathed a
legacy of discord and hatred at home and provoked
Russia’s displeasure abroad. The new
pro-Russian Government did its utmost to heal
the breach, and succeeded in improving relations
with Russia, but Stambuloff’s partisans agitated
in every possible way for the re-instatement of
the radical anti-Russian party. In Dushan
Petkoff and Evlogij Genadieff they had energetic
leaders, who pursued their goal with all the
characteristic Bulgarian tenacity and a ruthless
persistence that was positively Asiatic. After
Ferdinand had established a personal <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</em> in
Bulgaria, they realized that the turn of fortune’s
wheel no longer depended on the temper of the
nation or the strength of a party, but on the <em>will
of the ruler</em>, and they were content to bide their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
time. <em>Among the people they had no following
whatsoever.</em> But whichever party is in power
by the will of the ruler is assured of a majority
in the Parliament. Elections are invariably
manipulated by terroristic pressure from the
authorities. There is no difference except that,
whereas the pro-Russian parties are content to
employ demagogic means, the Stambulovists
have had recourse to bloodshed. At last the
Stambulovists were successful; they came into
power in 1902&mdash;(in accordance with the wish
of the highest power in the land)&mdash;and established
a reign of terror equal to that of Stambuloff
himself in its cruelty, but breaking all
previous records as regards corruption. The
Stambulovists commanded a crushing majority
in the Sobranye (Parliament) and pursued a
policy of secret provocations against Russia
and the nation. General Ratsho Petroff, a
personal favourite of King Ferdinand and an
absolute nonentity, was the Premier; but the
actual dictator and leader of the Stambulovist
party was Dushan Petkoff, Minister of the
Interior. Once more the policy of the Government
took an anti-Russian trend, but in the
meantime the nation had developed and steadfastly
pursued a different policy. To be sure,
under compulsion they had given the Government
a <em>majority</em> but not their heart, and this heart
now belonged to Russia more than ever. This
sentiment found expression in various violent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
demonstrations; it culminated in the assassination
of Petkoff (likewise in the open street)
and in the abuse showered upon King Ferdinand
as he drove to the opening of the National
Theatre at Sofia. From that point Bulgarian
policy took a totally new turn, and for a time
it seemed as if the Slav renaissance had really
taken root and Bulgaria had at last found
herself. The Balkan Alliance before the war
certainly seemed strong evidence of it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<p>Bulgaria’s relations with Serbia have varied
quite as much as those with Russia, but with the
difference that in these ups and downs the nation
has always been undivided. Bulgarian distrust
of Serbia dates from the beginning of the
political independence of the former. Instead
of trying to settle their differences in a brotherly
spirit, and to eliminate the Macedonian bone of
contention by fixing the spheres of interests,
both parties&mdash;especially Bulgaria&mdash;worked themselves
up into a fever of enmity which could
only be mutually detrimental. Actual frontier
collisions added fuel to the fire, and the situation
grew steadily worse. It is safe to say that there
was never any love lost between the Serbs and
the Bulgarians, even if political opportunism at
times dictated a more friendly attitude. Many
discerning Bulgarian politicians have often tried
to promote a more cordial and neighbourly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
understanding between the two states for the
sake of the Slav cause and the common good,
and their Serbian colleagues loyally supported
them in this. But their work was always undone
by the distrustful attitude of Bulgaria, which
was even increased by foreign influence. In
1885 the nation entered into the war with Serbia
with unanimous enthusiasm and a bloodthirsty
spite almost inconceivable between brother
nations. The war was fierce, and fate favoured
Bulgaria; but, instead of being content with
their success, and exhibiting a victor’s finest
quality&mdash;humanity, the Bulgarians only grew
increasingly bitter in their hatred towards Serbia,
and showed it in offensive taunts. After their
defeat the Serbs obviously could not feel very
friendly towards their neighbours, but I do not
believe they hated them in their souls. But
from one cause or another it was impossible to
find the way to friendship. The Bulgarians
declared that their differences with Serbia were
by no means settled in this war, and that the
Macedonian question would have to be decided
beyond dispute. Thus the war was continued,
unfortunately not only with the pen, but also
with arms, for the Serbian and Bulgarian bands
in Macedonia waged war upon each other more
fiercely than upon the Turks. Matters went
from bad to worse for both nations, and especially
for the Slav cause in the Balkans. Russia
exerted all her influence to reconcile the two, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
with no result beyond promises of amendment.
Several influential Slav personages were equally
unsuccessful until the youth of the Southern
Slavs entered the lists with a new plan of campaign,
and attacked the problem from <em>the standpoint
of Southern Slav Culture</em>. The authors
and artists of Croatia and Slavonia, who had
long stood in friendly relations with Serbia, made
it their business to include the Bulgarians in the
cause of Southern Slav Culture. As the intellectual
youth of Bulgaria was at that time passing
through a phase of national regeneration and
desired to widen their horizon, these efforts
fell on fruitful soil. Soon afterwards joint
exhibitions of Southern Slav artists were arranged
in Belgrade, Sofia, and Zagreb, and in
each case an Authors’ Congress was held simultaneously.
By these meetings and mutual intercourse
many sharp corners were smoothed away,
and many points of difference were abolished,
chiefly by the help of the Croats. Serbs and
Bulgarians meeting eye to eye at last realized
that they were brothers, sharing a common
future. The Exhibition in Belgrade coincided
with the coronation of King Peter, and we witnessed
the unexpected spectacle of Bulgarians
acclaiming the King with as much enthusiasm
as the Serbs. Those were the days of brotherhood
and fellowship. The representatives of
Bulgarian art and literature took their mission
seriously and sincerely, proving true apostles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
of peace and friendship between the two peoples.
They reaped considerable success, for the tide
of mutual enmity subsided, and when King Peter
came to Sofia on an official visit he met with a
reception that expressed not merely the pomp
and circumstance of a Court but the heartfelt
cordiality of a friendly people. It must not be
forgotten that in this <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rapprochement</em> good service
was rendered by those politicians of both countries
who persistently did their best to improve
mutual relations. Chief among these is the
Serbian statesman, Nikola Pašić. He cultivated
this mutual friendship so successfully that it
culminated in the Balkan Alliance, which would
have proved a lasting blessing to the whole of the
Balkans if it had not been broken by the attack
of Bregalnica. Yet the collapse of the Alliance
was not due to Bulgaria, but to other extraneous
influences.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<p>I have briefly touched upon Bulgarian relations
with Russia and Serbia in order to give a brief
sketch of the only too frequent mistakes made
by Bulgaria’s official Government. The Bulgarians
possess many excellent qualities, and, as
a nation, have a distinct claim on our respect;
but they have one drawback: they are not
independent in politics, and their policy is not
the outcome of the requirements of the times,&mdash;as
a rule it is not even suited to them, but is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
merely the mouthpiece of foreign influences.
Whenever these influences were Russian they at
least did not clash with the interests of the
people or do any particular harm. But, unfortunately,
Bulgarian policy has to a great extent
followed in Germany’s footsteps, and for a long
time German influence&mdash;especially in recent
years&mdash;has made alarming progress in Bulgaria.
The first to fall a victim to this influence were
Stambuloff and his followers who had made so
free with the motto “Bulgaria for the Bulgarians.”
And, in proportion to the vehemence
with which they pursued their corrupt policy,
they imported the German element into Bulgaria.
Intellectually it would be quite impossible to
Germanize the Bulgarians, but, as regards their
political economy and foreign policy they fell
more and more under German ascendancy.
The Eastern expansive policy of Germany and
Austria-Hungary, finding the doors fast closed in
Serbia, was content for the moment to ignore an
obdurate opponent, and insinuated itself into
Bulgaria as being free from the infection of
“fantastic Slav ideals.” In King Ferdinand, as
a German prince, German propaganda found a
distinct well-wisher. The Bulgarian stock market
was controlled by German trade, Austria-Hungary
and Germany founded branch banks and business
houses in Bulgaria. German and Austrian Ambassadors
could always command the ear of the
Foreign Office. And Germany bestowed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
favour or disfavour in proportion to the pro-German
or pro-Russian sympathies of the Government.
In face of this tide of Germanism all
honest Bulgarian politicians are confronted with
a herculean task, if the country is to be saved
from becoming simply a vassal state to Germany.
In the events which preceded the second Balkan
War their labours appeared to have borne fruit,
and Germany and Austria were suddenly confronted
with a fact they had never even contemplated&mdash;an
alliance between Bulgarians and the
detested Serbs, and even a military convention
between these two <em>against</em> Austria. But their
amazement was only a thing of the moment&mdash;German
influence redoubled its efforts, and the
second Balkan War was due to its machinations.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<p>Bulgaria’s defeat in the second Balkan War
has filled the nation with a burning, unquenchable
hatred against Serbia. The realization of their
Macedonian ambition, which had been almost
within their grasp, had vanished in a bitter
disappointment and plunged the heroic victors
of Kirkilisse into an agony of sullen despair.
When the first stupefying shock was over, the
thought of revenge came uppermost, and everyone
foresaw that at the next opportunity the
brother nations would again fly at each other’s
throats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>It would be unreasonable to deny the Bulgarian
claim to part of Macedonia. If a great
national problem is to be permanently and satisfactorily
solved, the principal of nationality
cannot be ignored. But Bulgaria exceeded the
principles of nationality in her demands and
aimed at a position of <em>supremacy</em> in the Balkans.
By her acquisition of Thrace it became necessary
to revise the stipulations of the Alliance Treaty,
and, if the Allies could have arrived at any conclusion,
or accepted the arbitration of the Tsar,
to-day the position of the Balkans in the present
crisis would be more favourable.</p>

<p>The Bulgarian nation cannot be held responsible
for the crime of Bregalnica. It merely
played a passive part. The official perpetrator,
supposed to have remained undiscovered to this
day, was guided not by the will of the nation,
but by orders from Vienna and Berlin, who
desired to be revenged for the affront they had
suffered through the Balkan Alliance. Nothing
short of a despicably devastating blow aimed
at all the Balkan States would suffice, and unfortunately
they found a ready tool in the wild
ambitions of certain Bulgarian circles. Of course,
the blow was aimed at the detested Serbians,
but with the relentlessness of fate it fell upon
those who had hoped to profit by the Austro-German
intrigue. Though Bulgaria alone suffered
material loss through the war, the whole of the
Balkan States have suffered morally. For their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
deadly enemy achieved his main object&mdash;the
breaking up of the Balkan union. Such was
the lamentable state of affairs in the Balkans
when the present European crisis came to a head.
The Austrian declaration of war upon Serbia
caused a positively insane joy in Bulgaria. It
was balm to the Bulgarian wounds that the great
monarchy should devour their small neighbor&mdash;<em>their
brother nation</em>&mdash;and not one of the heroes
who had helped in the conquest of Adrianople
be left alive! All this time they overlooked the
fact that, when Serbia had been disposed of, their
own country would have been the next dish
in the menu! It was a sordid triumph, neither
manly, nor <em>Slav</em>.</p>

<p>In their satisfaction they even forgot Russia.
No one dreamt that Russia would raise her mighty
hand and cry Halt! to the Austrian devourer.
But when the inevitable occurred, Bulgaria
suddenly found herself face to face with a problem.
Russia’s word&mdash;“Serbia’s enemies are my
enemies”&mdash;staggered the honest Bulgarian people,
who are attached to Russia, and they began
to ask themselves very seriously, “What next?”
The first upshot of this was the perceptible
cooling of the anti-Slav agitation; then the
nation began to reflect. The <em>people</em> and the
patriotic Slavophile circles sent their best wishes,
and their finest General&mdash;Ratko Dimitrieff&mdash;to
fight for Russia, and the official Government
proclaimed a strict neutrality. Both these facts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
bode well for the future. But the anti-Slav
agitation has by no means lost all its power,
and the Stambulovist circles, in conjunction
with Austro-German emissaries, have not ceased
to stir up the people and the masses against
Serbia and against Russia. Which will prevail?
It is difficult to make any forecast,
especially if one remembers the personal <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</em>
of King Ferdinand, who, in spite of the constitution
of the country, reigns supreme. At the
same time it would be wrong to lose hope and
we must trust that in the decisive hour the <em>Slav</em>
instinct will dominate all other instincts, and
thus not only assist the Slav cause, but also prove
of the greatest service to civilized Europe, and
above all things to Bulgaria herself.</p>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> free and independent kingdom of Serbia is
undoubtedly the most important of the Southern
Slav States, although she has only three and a
half million inhabitants, and is shut in on all
sides by her six neighbours&mdash;Austria-Hungary,
Roumania, Bulgaria, Greece, Albania and Montenegro.
In 1817 she was freed from the Turkish
yoke, and in less than 100 years she has developed
into a sturdy, self-reliant state, efficient in an
intellectual, economic and military sense in<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
spite of constant upheavals at home and abroad.
For all she is and has achieved Serbia is indebted
only to herself, to the capabilities, valour and
perseverance of her own children. Russia was
her only foreign protector. The Serb is a straight-dealing,
industrious man, and, like all the Southern
Slavs, essentially poetic. Judged by the standard
of modern <em>school</em> education the average Serbian
peasant is perhaps not so very far advanced, and
usually limits his accomplishments to reading
and writing; but he is keenly observant, and
his natural gifts and mother-wit are so great as
to warrant a very different forecast for his
future than exponents of German “Kultur”
have so far predicted. Like the Russian and the
Croat, the Serb is above all things a farmer, who
loves his bit of black earth, and cultivates it
with care; and from this love of the soil spring
his pleasures, his shrewd philosophy, his large
charity towards man and beast, and, above all,
his love of truth and justice. Shall not all the
world be just, even as the earth is just when
she bestows or withholds her gifts? From time
immemorial the Serb has had a great feeling for
family ties and the bond of the community.
The love he bears his own homestead he extends
to that of his neighbour, and then in a wider
sense to his whole country. Where his love of
country is concerned, political and economic
considerations take a second place. The Serb
loves his country as a bridegroom his bride&mdash;<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>passionately,
often unreasonably, but never with
calculation. He desires his beloved land for
himself&mdash;to keep it untouched by strangers. In
spite of considerable business capacity he is not
aggressive, and does not covet his neighbour’s
possessions. But, should his neighbour dare to
move his fence even one inch over the boundary,
or purposely let his cattle stray into his meadow,
then the Serb becomes fierce, wrathful and unforgiving.
The Serbian farmer has no need to
study history in order to learn where his neighbours
have removed his landmarks. His history
lives in his songs and ballads, and goes back a
thousand years. These poems tell him everything.
Every one of his beautiful folk-songs is a
piece of history, a bit of the past; and they sink
deeper into his heart than any historical education.
The <em>dates</em> of his power, past splendour and decline
are meaningless to him; but the sad, deeply-moving
legends in his folk-songs, telling of his
triumphs and his tragedies, plaintively thrilling
with love of country, and his tempestuous ballads
of heroism and revenge&mdash;<em>these</em> have fostered his
sense of patriotism, his yearning for his downtrodden
brothers, and his thirst for retribution.
These folk-songs have been handed down from
one generation to another, and to this day they
have been preserved in all their pristine purity of
text and melody in the souls and memories of
the Serbian people. It is not necessary at a time
of foreign menace to appeal to the Serb people<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
with elaborately-worded proclamations and inflammatory
speeches. The refrains of their songs
suffice, and they take up arms as one man. But
the cause must be in harmony with the traditions
of the past. They fight like lions when they go
to battle with their ancient songs upon their
lips. Thus did they war with the Turks&mdash;thus
they are warring now against Austria.</p>

<p>To the Serb the love of his language is second
only to his love of country. The most beautiful
and melodious of all the Slav tongues,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> rich in
idiom and soft in modulation, it is specially fitted
to be the medium of folk-poesy. This language,
which is identical with that of the Croats (thence
the name Serbo-Croat tongue), has been the
sacred and abiding link between the Serbs and
their still enslaved brothers in Turkey and in
Austria. The Serbian peasant is in the habit of
calling every one who speaks to him in a foreign
language a “Schwabo”;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> but should the stranger
address him in Serbian, or, indeed, in any of the
Slav tongues, he will say: “Pa ti si naš” (Thou
art one of us). Undoubtedly, apart from their
national music, this bond of union has been one
of the strongest factors in the preparation of the
future, for through it the Serb can freely communicate
with his brothers beyond the frontier.
Those dear familiar sounds tell him that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
brothers still live and share his speech, his songs
and his yearnings. This explains the unanimous
enthusiasm of the <em>whole</em> nation in the Balkan
War, as well as in the present second war of
liberation. They are not the soldiers of the
king who have gone to war, but the soldiers of
an <em>ideal</em>. The miracles of valour these men
have performed are not the exploits of a war-machine,
but of a great heart, in which hundreds
of thousands of hearts beat as one.</p>

<p>Many people, and especially Germans, have
said that the Serbs are dirty, lazy and dull. As
regards the last of these accusations I am
ready to admit that such Germans as have come
in contact with the people may be excused for
this impression. The Serbian peasant regards
the “Schwabo” with extreme distrust. His
natural shrewdness teaches him the wisdom of
appearing as dull as possible before the unscrupulous
exploiter he knows so well. It would
be no advantage to him to inspire confidence in
that quarter, and, as a matter of fact, the Serbian
peasant has often got the better of the apostles
of “Kultur” by this little deception. English
and French travellers, who have had dealings
with the Serbs, have spoken of them in most
flattering terms. As regards the other two
indictments, they are only absurd. The Serbian
peasant works very hard indeed. If we consider
the results of his labours, which can be gauged
by the considerable export of farm-produce and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
cattle, and remember that in so poor a country
as Serbia the farmer has not all the latest agricultural
improvements at his disposal, it becomes
obvious that he has achieved marvels by the
industry of his bare hands. The dirt commented
upon by his critics is nothing more than the
honest dirt of the soil on his hands and clothes;
but if the immaculate “Michels” had taken the
trouble to glance round his house they could not
have failed to notice that in cleanliness and
neatness most Serbian farm-houses compare very
well with the average farm-house of Western
Europe. A guest of gentle birth receiving hospitality
in a Serbian farm-house will certainly
find nothing to complain of in the way in
which he is fed and accommodated, and
his wants considered. Of course there are
cases of dirt and idleness in Serbia, but then
where shall we find a country quite free from
these...?</p>

<p>A prominent characteristic of the Serb is his
race-consciousness. Russians, Poles, Csechs, and
Bulgars are Russians, etc., <em>first</em> and only Slavs
in a general sense. But the Serbs and Croats
are as much Slavs as they are Serbs and Croats.
Possibly this has not always been so. Perhaps,
from being more oppressed and beset by foes
than any of the other Slavs, these nations have
come to look upon their sense of race as a sheet-anchor
to which they clung, at first with hope,
and then with heart-felt love. To a Russian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Slavdom is the symbol of his protectorate, but
to a Serbo-Croat it is the breath of life.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
In prehistoric times, the south-eastern tracts
of the Balkan Peninsula were inhabited by
Armenians, who were eventually compelled to
retreat to Asia Minor, about 700 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> The
next inhabitants were the Phrygians, who possessed
a well-developed civilization, and penetrated
very far westward; but with the invasion
of the Thracians from the north, the Phrygians
were likewise forced to migrate to Asia Minor
and only a few scattered groups were left between
the Danube and the Balkan Mountains, where
they remained until the Roman invasion. Unlike
the above-mentioned Semitic races, the Pelasgians
and Lepese, who formed the aboriginal population
of Greece, were of pure Indo-European
stock. They were eventually conquered by the
Hellenes, and the illustrious Greek nation sprang
from the intermingling of these three tribes.</p>

<p>The dawn of history shows the great Peninsula
of Eastern Europe divided between three tribes.
The Greeks dwelt south of Heliakmon and
Olympus, the Thracians west of the Tekton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>valley in the eastern portion of the Peninsula,
and the Illyrians west of the Pindus. Their
territory extended north as far as the site of
modern Vienna, and south to the Gulf of Corinth.
Of these three peoples the Greeks alone attained
to a high degree of civilization and culture.
They founded several colonies on the narrow
coast-line of Macedonia, but the greater part of
the Peninsula to the west of the Vardar remained
Illyrian, and, to the east of the Vardar,
Thracian. Only the wealthier classes and the
royal family from which Alexander the Great
traced his descent migrated into these countries
from Grecian Thessaly in search of conquest.</p>

<p>The Roman invasion was followed by considerable
colonial development. Under the
sound administrative policy of the Romans a
certain level of civilization penetrated to the
greater part of the Peninsula, and a Latinized
dialect became the general language. The
Thracians very speedily became Romanized, as
did most of the Illyrians; the Hellenes alone
retained their national distinction. The Illyrians
eventually disappeared from Macedonia; but
their kindred tribe, the Albanians (Skipetars,
Arnauts) remain there to this day, although they
show a strong admixture of ancient Roman and
Slav blood. The <em>Roumanians</em> are the product of
a lingual and racial mixture of Thracian, Roman
and Slav elements.</p>

<p>The Great Migration broke up the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
Empire (476 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>) and Europe was re-distributed&mdash;the
resulting racial boundaries having for the
most part persisted to this day. The Germanic
tribes set their mark on the North and West,
and the Slavs on the East of Europe. In 525 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
the Slavs under the name of “Εκλανεοι” are
mentioned as dwelling on the lower Danube.
From that time, and for a century, they waged
fierce warfare against the Eastern Empire, until
the latter became exhausted, and the Balkan
Peninsula was left open to the invaders from
the north.</p>

<p>In the first half of the seventh century, during
the reigns of the Emperors Phokas (602-610) and
Heraklies (610-642) the Slav hordes over-ran
the countries of the upper and lower Danube
like a flood from Venice to Constantinople,
sweeping southward as far as Cape Matapan.
The aboriginal inhabitants fled before them
and took refuge in mountain fastnesses, islands,
and walled towns. Christianity eventually tamed
these wild hordes, and peaceful intercourse was
once more established. Constantinople, Adrianople,
Seres, Salonika, Larissa and Patras were
the centres whence the light of Christendom
and Greek culture penetrated to the Slavs.</p>

<p>Who and what manner of people were the
Slavs? The Roman historian Jordanis (551 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>)
already distinguishes the “Sloveni,” as he calls
them, from the rest of the Slavs, whom he calls
“Veniti.” He speaks of an innumerable Slav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
people (“Venetharum natio populosa”) divided
into many tribes, of which the chief were the
“<em>Russi</em>,” (“<em>Anti</em>”) between the Dniestr and
Dniepr, and the “<em>Sloveni</em>” on the lower
Danube. It is true that a number of different
tribes were included under this name, just as
to-day it is used to designate the whole Slav
race (“Slavyane” in Russian, “Slovane” in
Csech). Strictly speaking only the Southern
Slavs have a right to this name, and until well
into the nineteenth century they styled themselves
“Sloveni” in addition to their local
appellations of Croat, Serb, Bulgar, etc. With
the formation of local states, the local names
came more into use, but in literature and folk-poesy
the name “Sloveni” is invariably adopted.
As a matter of fact, the local names arose from
the political and historical distribution of the
race.</p>

<p>The geographical position of the Balkan
Peninsula, as well as the two currents of civilization
which flowed in upon the Southern Slavs
from either side, prevented the formation of a
United Southern Slav State. They split up into
several lesser states, which soon lost their
freedom, and submitted to foreign rule. Carniola
was the first to fall a victim, for she passed
under German rule as early as the eighth century.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the seventh century the
Finnish tribe of the <em>Bulgars</em> conquered the Slav
tribes north and south of the Balkan range and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
incidentally adopted the Slav language as their
own. They merely retained their original name,
and their distinctive, coldly methodical genius for
organization&mdash;a racial characteristic which is
totally absent in the other Southern Slavs.
In a short time the Bulgars also conquered the
Slav tribes in Macedonia, Epirus and Thessaly,
and subjugated the whole country as far as the
Morava. In the ninth century the Bulgarian
Empire reached from the Carpathians in Hungary
to the Pannonian Valley, and, as a matter of
fact, Budapest, the capital of Hungary, was
founded by the Bulgars. The Bulgarian Tsar
Boris was baptized by the apostles Cyril and
Method, who also introduced the Slav liturgy in
Bulgaria. The Slav dialect spoken between
Constantinople and Salonika was adopted as the
literary language, and the <em>Glagolitza</em> (Glagolithic
alphabet) and eventually the <em>Cyrillitza</em> (Cyrillic
alphabet) were introduced. This fact is of
world-wide importance, for on this foundation
rests the whole subsequent intellectual development
of Russia and the Balkan Peninsula&mdash;in
fact, of Eastern Europe. Under Simeon the
Great (893-927) Slav literature reached its zenith&mdash;its
golden age. The Moravian monks, who
were driven out by Svatopluk, found a hospitable
welcome in the monasteries around the Lake of
Ochrida, and developed great literary activity.
The Southern Slav monasteries sent monks and
books to Russia, and thus they became the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
instructors of their mighty brothers in the North.
Still later, the Macedonian Empire was founded
and the Emperor Samoilo resided in Ochrida.
He, however, was soon overthrown by the
Byzantine Emperor Basil II. in the Battle of
Belassitza (1018). But the Bulgarian Empire
recovered again under Tsar Ivan Asen II.
(1218-1271) and had reached the zenith of its
power when it was shattered for centuries by
the invading Turks (1391).</p>

<p>The central Southern Slav (Serbian) countries&mdash;Illyria,
Moesia, and Dalmatia&mdash;for a long time
remained broken up into separate counties.
Not before the twelfth century did Rasa become
the centre of a Serbian state, founded by Stefan
Nemanya (1165), to whom the Serbs owe the
famous Nemanya dynasty. After their victory
over the Byzantines at Kossovo the Serbs penetrated
further and further south towards Macedonia.
Under Dušan Silni (1331-1355) Serbian
power reached its meridian. He organized the
nation into a state and gave the people good
laws. In his time Serbia reached from the Save
and the Danube to the Gulf of Corinth, and from
the Adriatic to Mesta on the frontiers of Thrace
and Macedonia. After the battle of Belbushde
(1330) even the Bulgars had to acknowledge the
supremacy of Serbia. The Serbian Metropolitan
of Petcha was made Patriarch, the National Serb
Church was founded, and, in the Macedonian town
of Skoplye, Dušan Silni proclaimed himself Tsar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
of the Serbs, Bulgars and Greeks. With an
army of 100,000 men he marched on Constantinople
in order to establish his throne there, and
to be revenged upon the Greeks who had a few
years previously called the Ottoman Turks to
Europe.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> But he died on the way,&mdash;it is said
that he was poisoned by a Greek.</p>

<p>Architectural and literary monuments from
the age of the Serbian rulers in the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries still clearly show traces
of the high degree of culture that had spread from
Byzantium, Venice and Florence. But these are
merely sparks which the Serbian discriminative
genius and natural ability would doubtless have
kindled into a bright flame had not the advent of
the Turks frustrated the great plans of Dušan
Silni. Constantinople would have remained in
the hands of a Christian people who love art
and progress. No other nation was so well
fitted as the Serbs to infuse new life into the
culture of the ancients. The presence of this
sane and strong young nation would have saved
the humanists their flight from Byzantium.</p>

<p>After the death of Dušan Silni the great
Serbian Empire crumbled into a large number
of small states, whose rulers played a dangerous
game, and intrigued one against the other,
whilst the Turks were conquering Thrace. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Macedonian despots became vassals to the Turks,
and only a few countries like Zeta, Bosnia, and
the empire of Prince Lazar (the Serbia of to-day)
maintained their independence. So long as these
countries were free, the Ottoman invasion of
Europe was delayed, because in the Kossovo
polje (the field of Kossovo) Serbia held the key
of Europe. The Turks knew this and constantly
prepared their attacks accordingly. On Vidovdan
(St. Vitus Day, 1387) 100,000 Serbs and
300,000 Turks met in battle on the Kossovo.
The battle was fierce and the losses on both sides
were enormous. The Serbs lost their Prince
Lazar and all their nobility; the Turks the greater
part of their army and their Sultan Murat I.
In Europe the report spread that the Serbs had
been victorious; in Florence and Paris all the
bells were rung for joy, and a service of thanksgiving
was held in Notre Dame, which was
attended by Charles VI. with all his Court.</p>

<p>Murat’s successor, Bayazit did not penetrate
further; he permitted the Serbs to retain their
own laws, but they had to acknowledge him
as their suzerain. In 1459 Serbia was finally
crushed and fell completely under Turkish rule.
Soon after (1463) the same fate befell Bosnia and
Hercegovina. Only the mountain fastnesses of
Montenegro remained unconquered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p>When Serbia began her life as an independent
State, she was still bleeding from the many
wounds inflicted upon her through centuries of
slavery, and first of all these wounds had to be
tended. The Serbian nation, intellectually and
economically bankrupt from long Turkish misrule,
was in the position of a merchant&mdash;an honest
fellow, but robbed to his last farthing, whose
ruined shop is being restored to him, and who is
expected to work up the old business to its
former prosperity out of these ruins. Years had
to elapse ere the people got accustomed to the
new order of things, and, out of the welter of
beginnings, found the way to sound civic development.
In those days Serbia fell a victim to
every political infantile disease, but on the other
hand she was inspired with a poetic, truly Slav
patriotism. Their golden freedom, which they
had so long yearned and fought for, and had now
at last won, affected the nation not as a political
event but as a great <em>family festival</em>, in which
all the members were united in love and joy.
They <em>revelled</em> in their new-found freedom; the
sordid considerations of the day were put off till
the morrow, or left to the care of a small body of
“cold-blooded” men. Civic law and order, and
regularity in the administration&mdash;unheard of
under Turkish rule&mdash;were first looked upon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
purely miraculous, and then tacitly accepted as
the inevitable consequences of freedom. The
idea of a <em>free State</em> is only of theoretical value to
the Serbs, the main thing for them is that they
should be a <em>free people</em>. As a free people they
followed their leaders&mdash;not as superiors, but as
children obey their fathers. With childlike simplicity
they gathered round their rural magistrate
to hear his instructions, and in the same spirit
they assembled under the ancient plane-tree in
the Topchider Park to hear Miloš, their first
Gospodar and Prince, dispense wise counsel and
even-handed justice. But in these council-meetings
between ruler and people was sown the
seed of the true constitution of the State, and,
like the empire of Dušan Silni in days gone by,
modern Serbia has grown up out of her own people.
And this is why Serbia is an <em>eminently nationalistic</em>
state, free and independent of foreign influence.
Perhaps in some ways this has been a drawback,
but it has also been a great source of strength to
Serbia. The intimate connection between the
reigning house and the people proved a bulwark
against foreign attempts at denationalization,
and gave Serbia the necessary strength to keep
herself free from Germany’s corroding influence
to this day.</p>

<p>In every way the patriarchal state of Prince
Miloš proved the best possible preparation for
Serbia’s political future. She matured slowly,
like an apple in the sun, and fortunately was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
compelled to ripen unnaturally. Moreover, the
inborn gifts of the Serbian people, which I have
already mentioned, proved a great help to this
process. They began to see that poetry has its
limitations, that a free people must become an
organized state, and that political order, though
it cannot be set in verse, is the only guarantee of
prosperity to the nation. Of course, legal decisions
and taxes were vexatious matters, but their good
effect on the community was recognized. The
law expressed the will of the people and was no
longer resented as an imposition.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for the young State that
<em>Dositij Obradović</em>, the greatest educational genius
of Serbia, had lived before this critical time. He
laid the foundations of a national educational
system&mdash;that most necessary discipline for a
young nation&mdash;and was beyond doubt one of the
greatest men the Southern Slavs have produced
in modern times. In Serbia he is called “<em>the
great sower</em>.” He truly sowed the seed of
enlightenment, not only in Serbia but wherever
Serbs and Croats live. Dositij Obradović has
not educated individuals, but whole generations,
and through them the entire nation. And if the
modern State is synonymous with civilization,
then Dositij Obradović was the true founder of
Serbia. He sowed the seed, all others have only
been reapers.</p>

<p>Prince Miloš, who abdicated in 1839, was
succeeded by his son Milan Obrenović II. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
died, however, within a month of his accession.
His successor and younger brother, Michael, was
soon involved in serious differences with the
Senate, and had to quit the country in 1842.
Serbia now elected Alexander Karagjorgjević,
son of the Black Kara-Gjorgje, who headed the
insurrection against Turkey in 1804. In spite of
his great gifts as a statesman, he failed to maintain
himself on the throne on account of his leanings
towards Austria. The nation, who instinctively
scented their ancient enemy, mistrusted him, and
matters finally came to a crisis in 1858. The
Serbian Skuptchina (Parliament) formally deposed
Alexander and again elected an Obrenović to
the throne of Serbia. This was Miloš Obrenović,
whose short reign was not remarkable for
any striking events. His son Michael succeeded
him in 1860.</p>

<p><em>Michael Obrenović</em> was a brilliant, broad-minded,
noble-hearted man. He found the national
harvest already well grown, and courageously
continued the work of his early predecessors.
He thoroughly understood his people, with all
their gifts and limitations, and, above all, he
realized that the moment had arrived for Serbia
to become “westernized” without sacrificing
her national qualities. He “Europeanized” the
State and made it respected at home and abroad.
The educational system made great strides and
was modernized in his reign. The finances of the
country were placed on a sound basis, agriculture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
was developed on modern, rational lines, and
industrial enterprise and foreign trade made
their first appearance. Under the strong guiding
hand of their prince, the organization of the <em>army</em>
kept pace with the economic development of the
nation. He initiated Serbian foreign policy<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> and
was the best and wisest diplomat of his country.
His policy towards Russia resulted in the Russian
protectorate, which has proved so powerful to
this very day, but it also aroused the jealousy
of Austria. Above all things Michael Obrenović
was a Serb, and his Slav policy was not only
carried on in the interests of the nation, but
dictated by his heart. He evolved the idea of a
Serbia with a seaboard on the Ægean as well as
the Adriatic. He knew that the future of his
country will never be secure until all Serbs and
Croats are united, and the ways open which will
permit of a corresponding economic prosperity.
Serbia’s demand for a seaboard is <em>not</em> mere
aggression, but the recognition of a vital problem
which will be disposed of as soon as her minimum
requirements are satisfied.</p>

<p>Under the next Obrenović, the jovial Prince
Milan (subsequently King Milan), Serbian policy
occasionally deviated from the lines laid down
by Prince Michael. Unfortunately, the good
services which <em>King</em> Milan undoubtedly rendered
his country are overshadowed by his many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
serious mistakes. At first his genial personality
and great popularity seemed to fit him very well
for the continuation and completion of the
work <em>Prince</em> Milan had begun. But apparently
his ambitions did not lie that way, for his reign
presents a long record of discord at home and
abroad. The party-spirit in civil and military
affairs assumed formidable dimensions, and the
State repeatedly barely escaped shipwreck.
Milan was a spoilt man of the world. He preferred
to live abroad and often left the administration
for long periods wholly in the hands of
the Cabinet of the moment, who, in the absence
of the ruler, often found it most difficult to
maintain their authority in the face of opposing
factions. Abroad the king became acquainted
with eminent foreign nobles and statesmen, and,
as in most cases these were Austrians, he fell
under the influence of the Monarchy. The tide
of German pressure towards the East began to
filter through into Serbia, and at times the
official policy was frankly pro-Austrian. The
King was still popular, but the people gradually
lost confidence in him, and on several critical
occasions he was fain to “save” himself by
brilliant addresses to the people.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> But the
Royal blunders became increasingly frequent,
and were further aggravated by intolerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
domestic dissensions which finally led to the
divorce of Queen Natalie. Fortunately Serbia
possessed singularly able statesmen during the
reign of King Milan, and it is solely due to their
efforts that the country escaped public disaster.
The present Serbian Premier, Nikola Pašić,
already played a prominent part in those days,
and repeatedly saved his King and country in
times of imminent danger. But presently matters
became intolerable, and King Milan abdicated
in favour of his son Alexander, who was still
under age. The reign of Alexander is the
darkest period in the history of modern Serbia.
During his minority the country was governed by
a regency, and all went well; but when Alexander
assumed the sceptre himself, the state
began to crumble in its very foundations. Mentally
deficient, and therefore dangerous in all
his actions, he inaugurated a rule of autocracy,
tolerated no opposition, and endowed every one
of his mistakes with the distinction of a “supreme
command.” The rift between King and people
grew wider and more impassable, and finally
became an abyss when he insisted on raising
his mistress Draga Maschin to the position of
legal wife and Queen of Serbia. But even this
was not all. The new queen, with all the blind
conceit of a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parvenue</em>, introduced the worst type
of petticoat government at court and in politics,
which showed itself in graft, corruption, unblushing
exhibitions of contempt for the people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
and insults to statesmen, scholars and especially
to the officers of the army. When the scandal
about the supposititious birth of an heir occurred,
the wrath of the people turned to fury, and, in
the night of May 28th, 1903, the garrison of
Belgrade carried out the sentence of the nation
upon the King and Queen.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<p>The accession of the Karagjorgjević dynasty,
who were really entitled to the crown, opens a
new national and political era for Serbia. An
old man was called to the throne, but a <em>grand
seigneur</em> of the best French school&mdash;a school
which did not produce debauchees and Boulevard-trotters,
but soldiers and statesmen of the first
order. King Peter was a Western European
in the best sense of the word. He was not only
of the blood of the black Karagjorgje, the scion
of a house of heroes, but an experienced soldier
and statesman. During the long years of his
exile he was an officer in the French army, and
in virtue of his social position had every opportunity
of garnering valuable experience both
in peace and in war. All this time he was
emphatically the “one who looked on” and
watched the development of his country from
afar&mdash;her struggles and her trials. Although he
never resigned his pretendership to the Serbian
throne he was often, surely very often, convinced
that he himself would never be called to ascend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
it. But his heart and his love ruled with the
Serbian people, and probably he felt the misfortunes
of his country more keenly than any
other Serbian. It is absurd to hold King Peter
responsible for the murder of his predecessor.
Any one privileged to know him would indignantly
repudiate the thought. His accession to
the throne was merely a consequence and in no
way a cause of the Obrenović tragedy. But
Europe was too horrified at the murder to discriminate
at the time, and would accept neither
reasons nor explanations proving the necessity
of making a fresh start&mdash;and this quite apart
from the circumstance of the murder. Europe
regarded the <em>deed</em> and not the <em>causes</em> of the deed;
and refused to search her own histories for
similar deeds provoked by similar causes. Thus
King Peter was confronted with a two-fold
difficulty. On the one hand both he and his
country had forfeited the sympathies of Europe,
and on the other he succeeded to the government
of a country demoralized by the previous
reign, and torn by party dissensions. It was a
most difficult situation, so many conflicting
interests had to be reconciled! Truly a very
weighty task for an elderly and perhaps already
world-weary man.</p>

<p>But King Peter did not come to Serbia as a
pretender who has at last gained the crown he
has coveted; he came as the champion of the
Serb ideal of the past&mdash;whose last representative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
had been Michael Obrenović,&mdash;the ideal of national
expansion, of a Serbian future. He recognized
his difficulties but attacked them without
flinching. For the Serb nation&mdash;impulsive,
tempestuous and sensitive&mdash;it was a blessing to
pass under the guidance of a calm, wisely deliberate
king. He went his way step by step, firmly,
and without illusions. Amid the tumult of
acclamations that greeted him in Belgrade his
was probably the only heart heavy with care.
He knew only too well that the violent <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup
d’état</em> was not the solution but merely the beginning
of the problem. This consciousness and
his patriotic ideal have been the ruling motives
of his reign from the very first. One of King
Peter’s first tasks was the rehabilitation of
Serbia in the eyes of Europe. Unjustly enough
the entire responsibility for the loss of Serbia’s
prestige was laid to his charge, and it was uphill
work to alter the opinion of Europe, but he
refrained from protestations and excuses. He
realized that Serbia must be regenerated in such
a fashion as to win back the full confidence of
Europe. By the wisdom of his policy and with
the help of able statesmen&mdash;principally Nikola
Pašić&mdash;he steered Serbia’s foreign policy back
into a healthy, normal channel, and within a few
years the country once more took her position
as a well-ordered European State&mdash;apart from
the calumnies and enmity of Germany and
Austria. In fact, this successful reconstruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
was proof in the eyes of Europe that the dynastic
change was a necessity for Serbia, and that in the
solution of the Balkan problem she might certainly
be trusted to take her part of the burden
as a civilized State. She proved her mettle
soon afterwards in the first Balkan War, for in
this war the ideal of the King&mdash;which he shares
with his people&mdash;scored its first great success,
when the hard-pressed nation displayed a high
degree of valour, statesmanship and true nobility.</p>

<p>In his ten years’ reign King Peter has gone
far to restore to Serbia her ancient glories.
During his reign her politics have become more
settled at home and abroad. Agriculture, trade
and industry have improved and expanded.
Literature and art have made miraculous strides,
so that Serbia may fairly consider herself the
equal of the Western nations; and the Serbian
army has now demonstrated its excellent organization
and great military value in three
successive wars.</p>

<p>King Peter, whose short reign became so
stormy towards the end, may look back on the
results of his labours with the same calm assurance
with which he took up the sceptre. He
has quickened the new soul of Serbia, and although
he retired shortly before the outbreak of the
present war, and entrusted the sceptre to his
son, his spirit still lives in his people and army
and&mdash;please God&mdash;will lead them both to victory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
IV.</p>

<p>Serbian relations with Austria have been an
important, and indeed the decisive, factor in
recent Serb history; and the events which are
the outcome of these relations will either bring
about the territorial consolidation of Serbia or
her final ruin. Austria-Hungary was never a
well-wisher of Serbia, although she has often
brazenly posed as her benefactor. It has always
been Austria’s aim to detach Serbia from
Russian influence, and to bring her under the
soul-saving protectorate of the Monarchy. The
nearest road to Salonika lies through Serbia, and
at all costs this route had to be secured. If only
Serbia could be made dependent upon Austria-Hungary,
it would be much better for the aims
of Germanistic expansive policy; it would also
paralyse the Southern Slavs in the Monarchy.
Knowing that the Great Powers, especially Russia,
would never permit an effective occupation of
Serbia, Austria sought by intrigues in the spirit
of Metternich to make her influence predominant
in Serbia, also economically to weaken her as a
state, by vexatious commercial treaties in the hope
of rendering her more amenable towards the
Monarchy. Serbia bravely resisted all these
attempts and suffered considerable material loss;
but she stood firm in the knowledge that she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
the first and strongest fortress in the way of
German pressure towards the East, and staunchly
believed in the ultimate success of her cause. The
brave little country had a mission to fulfil, not only
in her own interest, but in that of the Slav race
and the whole of Europe. Vienna and Berlin
knew that Serbia was a very hard nut, but they
felt confident of cracking it in the end. When
open aggression failed, they put a good face on
the matter, and assured the hard-pressed Serbs
of their kind intentions. The occupation of
Bosnia and Hercegovina was the first tangible
proof of these kind intentions, for on that occasion
Austria “delivered” two million Serbs and
Croats from Turkish bondage. Unfortunately
Serbia did not in the least appreciate this “benefit,”
whereby a large number of her kindred were
handed over to the tender mercies of Austria,
whose solicitous care of her Southern Slav
subjects was only too well known&mdash;in fact,
instead of being grateful, Serbia never ceased to
point out her own national and territorial claims
upon Bosnia and Hercegovina. Naturally this
insolent attitude on the part of Serbia provoked
the animosity, and presently the official disfavour,
of Austria. This disfavour was displayed on
every possible occasion although it always wore
a sanctimonious garb. Serbia was too weak and
unprepared to retort aggressively upon this
animosity; her defence was limited to diplomatic
measures and the moral support of Russia. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
was a marvellous achievement on the part of
her statesmen that in the face of strong popular
feeling they so long staved off an open rupture;
and that they did not let the thirty-five years of
misgovernment in Bosnia and Hercegovina, or
the oppression of the Southern Slavs, drive
them to a desperate decision. The influence of
European diplomacy was doubtless very helpful;
still, the Serbian people displayed admirable
restraint under constant provocation. Germany
and Austria, who are able to corrupt the greater
part of their own Press, and even many foreign
newspapers, and can command a whole staff
of political agitators, never relaxed their campaign
of abuse and calumny against Serbia, and
everywhere represented her as an incapable,
barbarous, and dangerous State. In this they
were only too successful. Unfortunately the
condition of Serbian home politics has often been
deplorable, and in addition to this the murder
of the King and Queen in 1903 provided ample
material for biassing public opinion in Europe.
On the whole Europe endorsed these calumnies
and refused to listen to the counter-protestations
of Russia and other Slavs, because the testimony
of barbarians and troglodytes was obviously
valueless. Serbia was frequently reduced to
desperate straits. She was really defending the
cause of civilization by stemming the tide of
Germanism in the East&mdash;she was <em>preparing</em> a
great world-work, and her reward was merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
contempt or a pitying smile. Without Russia’s
moral support she must have been swamped by
Austria long ago.</p>

<p>With the annexation of Bosnia and Hercegovina
in 1909 and the disgraceful circumstances
that preceded it (which I shall touch upon in a
later chapter), the mutual enmity between
Austria and Serbia reached its height. War
between Austria-Hungary on the one hand
and Russia and Serbia on the other, seemed
imminent, and was only averted by the intervention
of European diplomacy, especially by
the efforts of Sir Edward Grey. In a declaration
dated March 31st, 1909, Serbia acknowledged
the annexation as an accomplished fact, and
promised henceforth to conduct her policy in a
neighbourly and friendly spirit towards Austria.
This was the last act of self-abasement extorted
from the unhappy country, but by no means
the end of hostile agitations. On the contrary,
these only became more virulent, because Austria
considered the annexation of Bosnia and Hercegovina
merely a prelude to the invasion of Serbia.
Hence the necessity of representing Serbia as a
menace to the peace of Europe, and especially to
the position of the Monarchy as a Great Power.
Serbia’s prestige declined still further. But
suddenly a new contingency arose, and the
<em>Balkan War</em> of 1912 brought to light a series of
glorious proofs of heroism, self-control, statesmanship,
and military and national ability on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
part of Serbia. The contempt of Europe was
transformed into admiration, and Serbia suddenly
found herself appreciated at her true
value. This was a blow Austria could not
forgive, and still less the fact that the criminal
blunder of the second Balkan War, whereby she
fondly hoped that Serbia would be crushed,
proved unsuccessful. A strong and respected
Serbia was a thorn in the flesh to Austria and a
disquieting influence among her Southern Slav subjects.
Henceforth the Viennese Foreign Office concentrated
its efforts on the destruction of Serbia
at all costs. First of all Serbia was confronted
with a demand for such trade concessions as
would render her economically dependent upon
Austria, and the next commercial treaty was to
have placed Austria in the position of a “most
favoured nation.” In politics Austria had recourse
to the invention of the spectre of a “Greater
Serbia,”&mdash;an idea which hitherto had merely
possessed intellectual significance, and whose
representatives were a few hot-heads quite
unconnected with Serbian official policy. To
make this new propaganda convincing Austria
employed a large number of <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">agents provocateurs</em>,
whose masterpiece appears to have been the
attempt upon the Archduke Francis Ferdinand
at Serajevo, June 28th, 1914. Truly, when all
the side-issues are taken into account, it seems
more than likely that the <em>attempt</em> at least was
staged by Austrian agents. Was the assassination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
merely an accident?<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> It is to be feared that
this is one of the unhappy mysteries which will
never be fully cleared up.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br /><br />

<small>MONTENEGRO.</small></h3>

<p class="indent f85">The Country of the Black Mountain&mdash;Women Warriors&mdash;King,
Poet and Farmer&mdash;Historical Sketch of
Montenegro&mdash;Petar I., Petrović&mdash;Petar II.&mdash;Pro-Russian
Policy&mdash;A Royal Poet&mdash;Nikola I.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">All</span> I have said about Serbia applies equally to
Montenegro. The nations are one and the
same: they are identical in every respect and
only geographically divided. Montenegro is the
Serbian advance guard on the Adriatic. It is
the eagle’s nest of Europe, the loftiest symbol
of freedom and independence. Nature herself
has given this people an impregnable fortress,
and placed in their hands the keys of Southern
Slav liberty. From the height of their barren
Black Mountains the valiant high-spirited Montenegrin
has looked down for centuries on the
rise and fall of his kinsmen all around him. In
all the tragedies that have passed in the shadow
of his eyrie he has played his part, both as
dauntless warrior, and the bard of freedom who
from his mountain heights sang the song of the
future to his enslaved brothers. The Montenegrin
has always been the same. In war-time<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
he is a warrior, in times of peace a shepherd
armed to the teeth. He is inseparable from
his weapons, but only uses them against his
enemies. Though his aspect is martial and his
glance fierce, he bears a kindly, loveable heart.
Comparing his outward appearance with his soul,
one might call him a lion with the heart of a
dove. A friend, whoever he may be, is welcomed
with open arms, and his rough, powerful hand can
be gently caressing as a child’s. But an enemy
will be crushed by its weight; for the Montenegrin
<em>hates</em> his foe, hates him passionately,
fiercely and implacably, and he is ever on the
watch for him. Even at tender age the children
are decked with weapons and have to learn
the use of them under the eyes of their elders.
And the enemy is always the “Schwabo.” The
women are just as efficiently trained to arms
as the men, and it has often happened that the
Montenegrin Amazons played a decisive part in
warfare; and, when weapons were scarce, the
women rolled mighty rocks from the heights
down upon their enemies. Fighting is a grim
pleasure to the Montenegrin in war-time, and
his recreation in times of peace. Whoever has
travelled in the Montenegrin mountains cannot fail
often to have noticed two goatherds in the midst
of their herds, fencing with their “Handzars”
(the sheathless scimitar of the Montenegrins) and
not far off two goat-girls similarly engaged.</p>

<p>The Montenegrin is not a great farmer. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
soil is poor and barren; yet every patch of fertile
ground is utilized to the utmost of its resources,
and good soil is often carried from a great distance
and deposited in the stony corries for the
cultivation of a little maize and corn. But the
Montenegrin cares less for a full stomach than
for a light heart. It is a people that is for ever
singing, and the wealth of Serbo-Croat folk-songs
provides them with ample material.</p>

<p>The relations between the Montenegrins and
their rulers is without parallel in Europe. Certainly
the King is the “Gospodar” (ruler), but
he is really only the chief warrior, the chief
farmer, and the chief poet of his country. The
dynasty is descended from Montenegrin farmers
and is deep-rooted in the people themselves.
The Montenegrin does not consider his King so
much the head of the State, as the leader of the
nation, and relations between them are familiar
and fraternal. The King is the father, and the
people are his children in a perfectly patriarchal
sense. There is no trace of Western European
formality in their intercourse. The familiar
“thou” is used on either side, and the simplest
peasant shakes hands with the King as a matter
of course. But in war time the King’s word is
law, and the unquestioning discipline of the
people is founded on their mutual relations in
times of peace&mdash;founded on the love of the people
for their ruler.</p>

<p>The Montenegrins are Serbs by nationality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
and their Royal House, like that of Serbia, has
sprung from the people. Neither country has
ever been ruled by a foreign prince.</p>

<p>In olden times it was the custom that the
elders of the nation, without special regard to
diplomatic qualifications, should guide the fate
of their country by the rules of ancient custom.
Chief among them was the Vladika,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> who possessed
no special privileges as ruler but merely
took precedence in virtue of his ecclesiastical
dignity. His education was limited to what was
necessary for his clerical duties, and he knew
little or nothing of state-craft. The character
of a given reign depended mainly on the prevailing
relations with the Turks, and Montenegrin
affairs prospered in proportion to the peaceable
or aggressive attitude of these neighbours. A
well-ordered state, enlightenment, and education
were luxuries no one desired or required, and the
people lived and fought merely for the needs
of the day. But, although they are naturally
gifted, the nation could not develop without
any means of education; and, apart from the art
of war they were simple and unlettered as
children. Mere adventurers have several times
taken advantage of this simplicity. The most
flagrant instance was that of Stjepan Mali, a
Russian swindler, who gave himself out to be a
scion of the Vojevode family Petrović and proclaimed
himself lord of Montenegro.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<p>Affairs improved when Vladikas of Crnojević
family were succeeded by Vladikas of the
true Petrović stock in the leadership of the
country. The first of these, Petar I., Petrović,
was still content to follow in the footsteps of his
predecessors, and influenced the education of his
people only in so far as he himself was cultured.
His immediate successor Petar II., Petrović
Njegoš, earned undying fame in the history of
Montenegro.</p>

<p>Petar II. became Vladika and Gospodar of
Montenegro at the age of seventeen. At the time
of his accession he was scarcely more than a
Montenegrin peasant lad, accustomed to dealing
with attacks from the Turks, but otherwise
without education. The young ruler knew nothing
whatever of system or the deeper meaning of
learning and education, when he took the helm.
Times were troubled and difficult, for, even in
Montenegro opinions were divided. There were
several other pretenders&mdash;not so much because
of internal dissensions as in consequence of
foreign intrigue. It was not a matter of indifference
for the neighbouring states whether the
ruler of Montenegro was their friend and tool,
or whether he was a man of independent personality
and inclined to follow Montenegrin
tradition in considering Russia. The Sandjaks
of Skutari and Hercegovina (at that time still
the Sandjak Novipazar) were Montenegro’s
vulnerable point. For nearly a century Montenegro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
had already sought ways and means of extending
her territory as far as the frontier of modern
Serbia. Moreover, from the days of Peter the
Great an idea had existed that, with the help of
the Serbs of Old Serbia, and the Serbs and Croats
of Bosnia and Hercegovina, Montenegro should
prepare the way for the emancipation of her
kindred from the Turkish yoke. Poverty, however,
lack of numbers on the part of Montenegro,
and the vacillations of Russian diplomacy
frustrated these plans, and Vladika Petar I. did
not feel strong enough to embark on this enterprise.
Petar II. realized that, before Montenegro
could hope to attempt this task, she would have to
strengthen her hands&mdash;and those of her brothers
awaiting liberation&mdash;by a thorough-going pro-Russian
policy, which would secure them the
protection of the Russian Empire. She must also
provide her children with the means of education.
He knew well that nothing can be done with
an unlettered people. The lines laid down by
him were quite correct. Russian society understood
the Prince’s aims and gave him sufficient
financial assistance for the foundation of schools,
etc., and Russian diplomacy supported him
strongly in his politics. Petar II. set about his
educational mission with devotion and perseverance,
and even found time to complete his own
studies. When he attained to man’s estate he
was already famous as one of the finest of the
Southern Slav poets, and as one of the patrons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
culture among the oppressed Slav peoples.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> But
his path was by no means strewn with roses.
The very strength of his independent personality
laid him open to insidious intrigues. True, he
followed Russia’s advice, but, while he was still
a youth, full of the healthy, impetuous ardour of
his mountain home, he often transgressed the
rules of European diplomacy. Diplomacy failed
to understand his actions, and he, being a true
Montenegrin, could not wait with his hands folded
to see what diplomacy might achieve, while the
Turks were harrying his borders. Even the
Russian Consul in Dubrovnik (Ragusa) often
complained to his Government that the Prince
“was better fitted for a grenadier than for a
Vladika” (Bishop). And, of course, Vienna always
stirred up enmity against him. But Petar II.
remained a staunch Montenegrin warrior, and
the older he grew the less he was able to adapt
himself to the wiles of diplomacy. He devoted
himself to his people, who loved, honoured, and
revered him. But foreign intrigue began to
tell upon him. Disappointments increased with
advancing years, and he found little but bitterness
in the onerous duties of a prince; this
bitterness and disappointment find eloquent
expression in his poems. At last circumstances
became so unendurable to him that he thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
abdicating, and was probably only deterred from
his purpose by his ardent love for his people.
For, despite all vexations, he cannot have failed
to see that his presence was not useless and that
his work and activities were bringing a blessing
to his people and laying the foundations of the
future.</p>

<p>His nephew and successor, Danilo I., was the
last “Vladika” on the Montenegrin throne. He
was far better versed in the arts of diplomacy,
but his reign will never rival that of his uncle in
importance. He fell a victim to assassination
in 1860 at Kotor (Cattaro) and was succeeded
by his nephew Nikola I., the first secular prince
of Montenegro.</p>

<p>In Nikola I. fate bestowed upon Montenegro a
ruler with a remarkably strong character and
first-rate diplomatic talent. The country was
re-organized from within, without giving offence
to any of the sacred traditions of the Montenegrins.
In Nikola’s foreign policy veritable
masterpieces were achieved from time to time.
Without departing from the traditional pro-Russian
policy Nikola established excellent relations
with all non-Slav states, especially with
Austria, and made the utmost use of every opportunity
whereby his country and people might
benefit. A man of great personal charm, highly
cultured and refined, Nikola I. has enthusiastic
friends and admirers in every part of the world.
The unity of the Southern Slavs is one of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
favourite ideals, and he has laboured unceasingly
to promote this cause. His personal relationship
to several of the Royal Houses of Europe made
it possible for him to work effectively and win
friends for the Slav cause where another might
have failed to do so.</p>

<p>What Nikola I. has done for Montenegro
during the fifty years of his reign is more or less
generally known. The education of the people,
which began under Petar II., has made splendid
progress under Nikola I., and to-day Montenegro
can boast a large number of statesmen, poets,
scholars and men of letters for so small a country.
When the Balkan crisis arrived, Nikola, then
already King of Montenegro, true to the spirit
of his fathers, unhesitatingly and enthusiastically
placed himself and his people at the disposal
of Serbia and won glorious victories, in consequence
of which his territories were considerably
enlarged. After the Balkan War, King Nikola
surely looked forward to a time of peace and
prosperity. But his hopes were doomed to
disappointment, for recent events have called
him to another and more important task.</p>

<p class="indent f85">IV. Dalmatia, Istria, Carniola&mdash;The Italian Element&mdash;Bosnia-Hercegovina&mdash;Conclusion.</p>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>The whole south of the Dual Monarchy is inhabited
by Slavs. The Kingdoms of Croatia,
Slavonia, and Dalmatia, with the Duchy of
Carniola, Istria, and Bosnia-Hercegovina&mdash;these,
comprising a population of about seven millions,
belong almost exclusively to one race. Whereas
in all other countries of the Monarchy (especially
in Hungary and Bohemia) the different races are
represented in varying percentages, the non-Slav
population in Croatia, Slavonia, Bosnia and
Hercegovina amounts only to about 5-1/2 per cent.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
in Carniola and Istria to 4 per cent., and in
Dalmatia only to 2 per cent. The considerable
number of Croats and Slovenes (750,000) living
in Southern Hungary (in Torontal, Bacs-Bodrog
and Temes) must be added to the above-mentioned
seven millions.</p>

<p>Ethnologically speaking, the inhabitants of all
these countries form one people, and are a brother
nation to the Serbs in the Kingdoms of Serbia and
Montenegro. Their language, customs, historical
past and achievements in art, science and literature,
are identical. The sole difference between
them is that the Croats and Slovenes are Catholics,
while part of the inhabitants of Bosnia are
Mohammedans. Those confessing the Serbo-Orthodox
faith (more than a third of the population)
also own to the national name and call
themselves Serbs. This compact and homogeneous
national body would certainly have
become a most important factor in the Monarchy
had they not been cut in two by administrative
policy. Here as elsewhere throughout all her
dominions Austria has applied her principle of
dividing and dismembering, and the Southern
Slav provinces were shared between two spheres
of power. Croatia and Slavonia were allotted to
the Hungarian; Carniola, Dalmatia and Istria
to the Austrian sphere, and a mixed Austrian
and Hungarian administration was introduced
in Bosnia and Hercegovina. This system made
a unanimous political rally of the Southern Slavs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
quite impossible, and provided German and
Magyar propaganda with a more manageable field
of operations. In both spheres unremitting
efforts were devoted to the task of eliminating
the Southern Slav element, stifling Slav thought,
and transforming the Slavs into <em>slaves</em>. But the
Southern Slav is endowed with unusual tenacity;
the most zealous efforts on the part of the Government
were frustrated by his dogged resistance,
and they merely defeated their own ends. German
“kultur” and Magyar <em>lack</em> of culture were held
in equal abomination by the Slav nations upon
whom they were to be inflicted, and the ruthless
spoliation to which they were likewise subjected
engendered a deep-seated animosity. The
Northern Slavs, who possess more practical
business capacity than the Southern, did not
allow themselves to be economically strangled,
and even contrived to hold their own in this
respect; whereas the Southern Slavs, being mainly
an agricultural people, found themselves the
helpless victims of Austrian and Hungarian
rapacity. Dalmatia, one of the loveliest spots in
Europe, has for the last century known no
privilege except that of paying taxes, and Austria’s
mal-administration of that country has become
proverbial. Croatia and Slavonia fare little
better. They have to pay 56 per cent. of their
revenues to Hungary. This tax figures under
the head of “contributions to mutual interests,”
chiefly represented by the railways and the postal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
system. The net annual income from these
two sources amounts to 250 million Kr., but
of this Croatia never receives a penny! The
net profit <em>all</em> goes to Hungary who brazenly
employs it to subvention the Magyar propaganda
in Croatia. The condition of Carniola
and Istria is almost as deplorable as that of
Dalmatia, and in Bosnia and Hercegovina the
Austro-Hungarian Government has for thirty-five
years built villages “after the pattern of Potemkin,”
for the edification of foreign journalists,
while the people have been left to starve, or
sink into poverty and ignorance. The numerous
foreign tourists who have travelled in these
beautiful countries have seen nothing of Austria’s
“work of civilization,” as they are kept to the
beaten tracks specially prepared for them, and
they only see the country like a carefully staged
panorama on the films of the Royal and Imperial
State Cinematograph! But had these travellers
caught a glimpse of the abject misery of the
people, their pleasure in these beautiful countries
would have been spoilt, and they would have
better understood why the inhabitants are rebelling
against the “blessing” of Austro-Hungarian
rule.</p>

<p>It is much easier to understand why the political
horizon in the Southern Slav corner of Europe is
always clouded if one is given a clearer view of
the <em>Chartered rights</em>, as opposed to the <em>actual
position</em>, held by the Southern Slavs in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Monarchy; but this view is not usually obtained
through the official channels of Vienna and
Budapest. According to these, all ancient <em>charters</em>
of liberty are so many “scraps of paper,” and
the actual law merely the right of the strongest.
The Hapsburgs did not come as victors with the
rights of a conqueror to the Southern Slav provinces.
They became rulers of these countries in
virtue of voluntary treaties, and they themselves
issued manifestos and bulls, in which the integrity
and independence of the Southern Slav countries
are incontestably guaranteed. Centuries ago, while
the Hapsburg dynasty was endangered by constant
wars, and especially during the Turkish invasion,
these guarantees were faithfully observed. But
with the altered conditions of affairs the Southern
Slavs had to wage a bitter struggle for their
rights.</p>

<p>Of all this group Croatia-Slavonia alone still
retains the slightest degree of autonomy, while
the countries belonging to Austria have been
deprived of every vestige of self-government,
and only appear to be distinct dominions in the
State by their mock Landtags, whose decisions
are almost invariably disregarded. Croatia-Slavonia,
which belongs to Hungary, has to this
day at least theoretically maintained her political
independence. Croatia was once more guaranteed
this independence by the agreement between
herself and Hungary in 1868. When the Hapsburg
Empire was reconstructed in 1867 the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
constitutional independence of Croatia could not
be set aside, especially as this reconstruction
was founded on the Pragmatic Sanction, which
provided for the separate constitutional independence
of Croatia under guarantee of the Royal
Oath. Moreover, the events of the revolution
of 1848 were still too fresh in the memories
of the Hungarian statesmen who had laboured
for the establishment of Hungary’s State Constitution
from 1861 till 1867, and in their dealings
with Croatia they did not dare to repeat the
mistakes they had made in 1847 and 1848.
Francis Deak, the chief of these statesmen, knew
very well that the catastrophe that overtook
Hungary in 1848 would never have been so
great, if the Croatian national forces had fought
side by side with Hungary. Thus it was his
wish to conclude a lasting peace with Croatia
on a just basis. Under Deak’s influence, and
with the co-operation of Croatia’s leading representatives,
an agreement was concluded which
assured Croatia the position of a State enjoying
equal rights with Hungary, with complete self-government
as regards her internal affairs, a
separate legislative parliament, and her own
army; only the railways and the postal and
financial systems were to be under mutual
control, and Croatia was guaranteed a proportionate
share of the revenues from these sources.
The Croatian tongue was to be the official language
in the Landwehr, and in all courts of law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
whether joint or autonomous. The important
Croatian seaport Fiume was declared a “corpus
separatum adnexæ <em>rex</em>,” and thus constituted
a joint open port. I shall presently show how
Hungary kept her side of the bargain.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<p>A Southern Slav patriot has said that no
greater misfortune has befallen the Southern
Slavs, than to pass under the dominion of civilized
Austria. Had they been obliged to share the
fate of their brothers, the Serbs and Bulgarians,
they would certainly have tasted all the misery
of the Turkish yoke, but to-day they would be
free, as an independent State with a right to
their own national and intellectual development.
The one thing Turkey has left untouched in the
Serbs and Bulgars&mdash;<em>the heart of the people</em>&mdash;is
the very thing that Austria has sought to
destroy in her Southern Slav subjects. Turkish
captivity has steeled the hearts of the Slavs she
oppressed, but Austrian captivity has cankered
them and made them effete.</p>

<p>In many respects this pessimistic view is
justified. The struggle of the Southern Slavs for
national life has passed through many phases,
and has exhausted itself in many more. For
centuries the Southern Slav stood under the
protection of “Heaven militant,” and his motto
was “For Faith and Freedom,” for with him faith
was always first. All his culture consisted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
imaging the Christ as the “Otac i voyskovodya
illyrskyh Kralyeva” (Father and leader of the
armies of the Kings of Illyria). The Holy Cross
was transformed into a standard of war, and his
enthusiasm for this false ideal led him so far
astray, that the <em>baptized</em> arch-enemy was nearer
to him than his own <em>unbaptized</em> brother, and
the Church dearer to him than his country.
But these traits do not originate in the character
of the Southern Slav. He was educated into them
and impregnated with them from without, and
always by his greatest enemies, the Germans or
the Turks. The Germans made a national
mission of the Crusades, and the Turks usually
went to war on religious grounds and called their
armies the Hosts of the Prophet. Following the
example of the Turks, and imitating the Germans
in their appropriation of the Deity, Slav Christianity
was infected by the fanaticism of the
Church of Rome, and became synonymous with
militancy and the spirit of the <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">condottieri</em>. The
heart of the nation grew vitiated, and the Illyrians
callously neglected their lovely land, which ought
to have been a Garden of Eden. And those who
were so liberal with their promises of Heaven
and constantly cried, “Thy Kingdom is not of
this world!” were well pleased that these things
should be so, for they coveted the lost Empire
of the Southern Slavs for an earthly paradise of
their own.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this dark page in the history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
Southern Slavdom followed directly upon one
of the most brilliant periods in the intellectual
development of Southern Slav culture. It was
a period when the national culture of the Southern
Slavs put forth some of its most vigorous, fairest
and sanest blossoms&mdash;the time of the Bogumili
(“beloved of God”) whose work of enlightenment
spread from Bulgaria over the whole of the Slav
South. The Bogumili were strongly opposed to
the poetic glorification of the Crusades, because
they grasped the fact that the extolling of such
an ideal can never open the mind to <em>heretic</em> culture&mdash;the
culture based on <em>free choice according to
conscience</em>&mdash;which was eventually to undermine
the foundations of the sacrosanct Roman Empire
and lay the first solid foundations of <em>true</em> culture.
The Bogumili taught that true culture is not
spread by crusades, but springs from Christian,
human contemplation. They deprecated personal
worship, and replaced it by a worship of ideals, of
spirit, and of thought. Wyclif, Huss and Luther
are always quoted as the foremost apostles of the
<em>heretical</em> culture. But in the Hungarian Crusaders
the Bogumili found bitter enemies. Bogumilist
activity in Bosnia and Croatia was stifled in blood,
and the people, who were beginning to protest
against the lying cult of Cæsarism wedded to
Papistry, were simply butchered in the name of
the Cross. The blood-baths on the fields of
Bosnia filled the people with consternation, but
could not stifle Bogumilism. True, its progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
was checked in the Southern Slav region, but it
secretly penetrated westward, whence the Patarenes
in Italy and the Catharists, Albigenses and
Waldenses in France spread it all over the world.
It is interesting to note that at the very moment
when Bogumilist culture was destroyed among
the Slavs themselves, they bequeathed this very
Bogumilism to the rest of Europe&mdash;the first and
only gift from the Southern Slav race <em>as a whole</em>
to the spiritual life of Europe. It was the true
“antemurale Christianitatis”&mdash;the outworks of
Christianity&mdash;purified from Byzantine and Roman
elements. <em>What they gave</em> was perhaps not so
very much their own as the <em>vigour</em> with which
they transplanted the ideal and the doctrine
of a spiritual life, from the mountains of Asia
Minor to the West. Theirs was the work of
emissaries and outposts.</p>

<p>To resume, during the time of Turkish power,
the Southern Slavs had ceased to be the “outworks
of Christianity” and had become merely
a <em>soldatesca</em> in the service of the foreigner, fighting
indifferently for Cross or Crescent. It was
a terrible time of national abasement, more
especially because it followed so closely upon the
great era of spiritual exaltation. The gradual
loss of Southern Slav independence likewise
dates from this period, and from that time until
quite recently they were unable, <em>as a race</em>, to
produce a truly Southern Slav culture. Only
those among them who travelled westward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
where Bogumilism continued to thrive and
flourish, found the way of true culture. Among
these exceptions were Marko Marulić (Marcus
Marulus), a Spalatine noble, whose works were
translated from the Latin into all the principal
European tongues, and Flavius Illyricus, whom,
after Luther, Germany considers one of her
greatest teachers. In their souls these men
were merely Bogumili and nothing more. With
them we may also class John of Ragusa, who
led the whole Council of Bâle against the Pope
and proposed to negotiate calmly and justly
with the Hussites and Manichees. Just such a
man was Bishop Strossmayer in our own day,
a man of whom I shall presently speak further.</p>

<p>Their liberation from the Crescent put an end
to the period of religious militancy among the
Southern Slav people. The warlike element is
perhaps of great historic moment. It certainly
fended the Southern Slavs over the abysses of
Turkish barbarism to freedom in the Christian
sense of the word, but by no means to national
freedom. When the Turkish invasion was rolled
back and the everlasting wars were over, the
symbol of the sword was exchanged for that
of the plough, and God as God was no longer
adorned with weapons, but imaged in a nobler
spirit as the highest conception of <em>peace</em>. And,
as the people accustomed themselves to peace,
and once more came in touch with the soil, a
new spirit grew up within them, or rather it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
was the re-awakening of an old spirit that for
a while had been silenced by the clamour of
weapons&mdash;the spirit of love for the homestead
and the community. Nationalism still slumbered
but, like a guardian angel, the <em>national
tongue</em> watched over its slumbers. Through
storm and stress, in spite of travels and intercourse
with foreign-speaking mercenaries, this
language has remained pure and unalloyed. This
was the seed of the future from which sprang
the great awakening; for so long as a people
preserves its language it possesses a Nationality.</p>

<p>Liberty of conscience, and the transformation
of the warrior into a husbandman, were also the
beginning of a change in the souls of the people,
which, while groping its way back towards its
own essential beauty, began to feel the hidden
wounds within, and strove to rid itself of the
canker. The old beautiful mode of life, the
patriarchal family feeling and the bond of union
in the community were restored, and the gentle,
plaintive melodies echoed once more in farm
and field. And this regeneration grew and
expanded until it brought the revelation of
national union, patriotism, and finally the love
for all that belongs to the Slav race.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<p>The Napoleonic era found this people already
fully developed. They had found their soul
and knew what they wanted. Napoleon, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
treated most of the people he conquered without
much consideration, was filled with unusual
admiration for the Southern Slavs that came
under his rule. By the peace of Schönbrunn
(October 14th, 1809) he acquired Triest, Görz,
Carniola, part of Carinthia, Austrian Istria, the
Croat seaboard with Fiume, and all Croatia
south of the Save. Napoleon united all these
countries with French Istria, Dalmatia and
Ragusa into one “Province of Illyria,” and thus
for one short moment fulfilled the dearest wish
of all the Southern Slavs. Illyria was organized
as one military province divided into six civil
provinces; Maréchal Marmont was appointed
Governor and in the name of Napoleon carried
out sweeping reforms throughout the country.
Trade and industry were signally improved and
the people were granted far-reaching national
liberties. The use of German as the official
language was abolished in the schools and law
courts and Serbo-Croatian introduced in its
place. Special attention was devoted to road-making
and education, and the Croats were
permitted to edit their own newspapers in the
Croat tongue, which would have been considered
high treason under Austria. Although the
French rule was only of short duration (till
1817) <em>it did more for the Southern Slav lands in
three years than Austria did during the century that
followed</em>. But the main thing was that this rule
aroused the national thought so effectively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
that henceforth it ceased to be a dream and
became a factor to be reckoned with. From
that time dates the unremitting struggle against
Germanism and Magyarism, and the agitation
for a national union of all the Southern Slavs.</p>

<p>The first-fruits of the complete national regeneration
were seen in the great movement started
in 1835 and known by the name of Illyrism.
Illyrism began with a small group of patriots
and poets whose leaders were Ljndevit Gaj and
Count Janko Drašković. They founded newspapers
and periodicals, published patriotic books
and poems, and roused the national enthusiasm
of the people to the highest pitch. In this mission
they successfully sought help and advice from
other Slavs, especially the Csechs and Serbs;
they were also the first to come into touch with
Russia. Austria-Hungary tried sharply to repress
this movement, and for the first time found herself
confronted by a united nation bent on going its
own way. The Illyrist movement cannot point to
any positive political results, but it laid a foundation
for future political and national activity and
did an incalculable amount of pioneer work
which would have been most difficult to carry
out under the conditions that followed. In
1843 the name of Illyrism was prohibited by an
Imperial edict, and it was hoped by the Austrian
authorities that this would be the end of the
patriotic movement. But their labour was lost.
In fact, under the spur of persecution the patriots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
passed from their idealistic literary campaign to
more tangible activities. By the prohibition of
the Illyrian name the motto of the poetic propaganda
was lost, and it became the duty of the
patriots to lead their politics into less sentimental
paths, and enter upon a campaign of cold
reasoning in place of poetic sentiment. This
was all the more necessary as the national cause
was greatly endangered by several new regulations.
Following closely upon the prohibition
of the Illyrian name came an order for the
introduction of the Magyar tongue in the Croatian
law courts. When the Croatian counties protested
in Vienna that Croatia was privileged
to choose her own official language, and that
no one had the right to interfere with this privilege,
they met with a brusque rebuff. Up
to now the Government had hardly dared to
attempt the Magyarization of Croatia, but now
they decided to enforce it in spite of the newly-awakened
national consciousness. The Croats
now realized that it was a case of war to the knife.
The Hungarian Government proclaimed that
all countries and nationalities subjected to the
crown of St. Stephen must be made one people,
one state, and be taught to speak <em>one</em> language&mdash;in
short, they were to become Magyars. They
were determined to break the national resistance
of the Serbs and Croats by force, or preferably,
by corruption. In this enterprise
Hungary found an able assistant in Ban Haller.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
A “Magyar party” was organized in Croatia
with a view to reconciling the people to Magyar
demands, but, unfortunately, it consisted chiefly
of adventurers and social riff-raff; the work of
Magyarization made no progress, but only
further incensed the Southern Slavs. One of the
consequences of this hatred was that in 1848 the
Croats and Serbs enthusiastically followed Ban
Jellacić in the campaign against Hungary.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<p>After the conclusion of peace between Hungary
and the Crown the Croats were rewarded in a
truly Austrian fashion for their assistance in
putting down the rebellion: once more they were
handed over to the tender mercies of Hungary.
This ingratitude roused a perfect tempest of
indignation, but at the same time the Southern
Slavs finally learnt their lesson. Henceforth
they would look for help to no one but themselves,
and they resolved that the coming struggle must
be fought to a finish. The Southern Slav leaders
knew very well that nothing could be done by
revolutionary propaganda, but that their first
task must be to establish a footing from which
they could conduct a constitutional campaign.
They formed a strong Nationalist party in
Croatia, which co-operated with the Dalmatine
and Slovene parties, laid down their programme
on a broad national basis, and organized a campaign
of passive resistance among the people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Of course the success of these labours was largely
due to the fact that Hungary was weakened by
the revolution and inclined to be somewhat
less aggressive. Croatia, on the other hand, was
fresh, strong, and self-reliant. Of course the
results were not apparent at once, but the agreement
of 1867 was a consequence of Croatia’s
united stand. This agreement by no means
satisfied all the aspirations of the Southern Slavs,
but it gave them the required footing against
Magyar oligarchy. Upon the conclusion of the
agreement, Croatia received her first constitutional
Ban, who was henceforth to be responsible
to the <em>Croatian Parliament</em>. Unfortunately the
King made this appointment upon the recommendation
of Hungary, who saw to it that the
first Ban, Baron Levin Rauch, should be a
mere exponent of the Hungarian Government.
Contempt of the constitution, and corruption,
were the first-fruits of the agreement under
Hungarian influence in Croatia, with the result
that all Croatian patriots&mdash;including those who
had helped to conclude the agreement&mdash;passed
over to the Opposition. This Opposition worked
on rigidly constitutional lines, and, as more
radical parties arose, they formed the constitutionally
correct, though barren, Croatian Constitutional
party. Space forbids me to enumerate
all the means by which the first “constitutional
Ban” strove to carry out his orders from Budapest.
By suddenly imposing a new election law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
he secured a large and obsequious majority in
Parliament, which effectively barred the co-operation
of the Opposition in national affairs.
But the Opposition attacked the Government
<em>outside</em> Parliament, through the press. When
this systematic corruption and disregard of the
agreement had gone too far, M. Mrazović, the
leader of the Opposition, published a sensational
indictment against Baron Rauch, accusing him
of underhand dealings. Baron Rauch took proceedings
against Mrazović for libel in the military
courts, but Mrazović substantiated his accusations
and was acquitted. Baron Rauch resigned, and
the Nationalist Party scored its first victory.
He was succeeded by Ban Bedeković, another
Hungarian nominee, who was, however, unable
to prevent a triumphant Nationalist victory in
the election of 1871. The Hungarians asserted
that this victory had been subsidized by funds
from Russia and Serbia, and this accusation
contains the substance of all subsequent charges
of high treason. The Opposition replied with a
manifesto, in which they clearly set forth the
gravity of the numerous infringements of the
constitution. Because of this manifesto, the
Government wished to take proceedings against
the leaders of the Opposition for high treason, but
they refrained through fear of offending European
public opinion. At this time the Constitutionalist
Kvaternik, a good patriot but wholly unpractical,
started an armed rebellion among the peasantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
in the Rakovica district. It was put down by
a strong military force, and Kvaternik lost his
life. The October manifesto, in conjunction with
the rebellion in Rakovica, afforded Andrassy
(then Minister of Foreign Affairs) a pretext for
opposing every form of Slavophile policy and
ascribing both the manifesto and the rebellion
to Russian influence.</p>

<p>The policy then inaugurated remains in force
to this day. Brutal Imperialism is rampant
in Croatia, and the Agreement has become a
mere “scrap of paper.” But oppression begets
opposition, and during these critical times the
Southern Slavs found not only their greatest
tyrant but their greatest patriot. From 1883
to 1903 Count Carl Khuen-Hedervary was Ban of
Croatia, and the twenty years of his administration
have been the blackest period as regards
political, economic and personal thraldom.
Countless Magyar schools were scattered throughout
the country to promote the denationalization
of the people; espionage and Secret Police
flourished as in Darkest Russia. The archives of
the State, with the Constitutional Charters of
Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia, were incorporated
with the State archives in Budapest, and, <em>last
but not least, the Agreement itself was falsified by
the pasting of a slip of paper over the specification
of Fiume as a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Corpus separatum adnexæ rex”</span></em>
converting it into a “corpus separatum adnexæ
<em>Hungariam</em>,” whereby this important Croatian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
seaport became exclusively Hungarian property.
But this same period also witnessed the labours
of the greatest of all Southern Slavs, the benefactor
and father of his people, Bishop Josip
Juraj Strossmayer.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>Bishop Strossmayer (1815-1905) was the most
generous benefactor of his people, their greatest
patron of science and art, and the very incarnation
of their political programme. He was
the first to break down the local artificial barriers
between Serb and Croat&mdash;the first to preach the
gospel of united Yougoslavia. Labouring in a
period when all national effort was suppressed in
every possible way, when Slav sympathies were
accounted high treason, he rose to a position of
unassailable eminence, which enabled him to
set the mark of his powerful personality like a
leitmotive on the whole nineteenth-century history
of the Southern Slavs. Born of peasant stock
and, like all gifted Slav boys, destined for the
church, Strossmayer began his patriotic activity,
while he was still a student and youthful priest,
by joining the Illyrist movement. His exceptional
abilities were soon noticed in connection
with the national movement, and Vienna and
Budapest awoke to the dangerous possibilities
of his personality. Determined to put an end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
to his patriotic labours they appointed him
court chaplain, and trusted that the society of
the court with all its splendour and gaiety would
dazzle the handsome young priest, and wile
him away from the service of his country. But
Strossmayer made a most unexpected and highly
diplomatic use of his position. He brilliantly
succeeded in deceiving his surroundings as to
his sympathies, and when barely over thirty he
secured his appointment to the Episcopal See
of Djakovo. Hereby he also became Vladika
of Bosnia and Syrmia, and shortly afterwards
was created governor of the Virovitica district.</p>

<p>At this point Strossmayer’s life-work for his
people began in earnest. Holding a most distinguished
position, and with the vast revenues
of his bishopric at his disposal, he opened the
flood-gates of his activities, and Vienna and
Budapest saw with horror and amazement the
mistake they had made. Strossmayer assumed
the leadership of the Nationalist party; and in
Parliament, where he took his seat in the double
capacity of bishop and elected deputy, he showed
himself a brilliant orator, a subtle politician,
and an astute diplomat. He was the incarnation
of a keen, but determined and wise Opposition.
He also became an intellectual leader of his
people and accomplished more than anyone else
before him. He founded the Southern Slav
Academy of Science and Art, which in the very
terms of its foundation embodies the intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
unity of the Southern Slavs. He also founded
the Croatian University; and, being a great art
connoisseur, he spent years in accumulating an
exceedingly fine private collection, which he
presented to the nation. He built the Cathedral
at Djakovo, and at his own expense sent hundreds
of young Serbs and Croats to foreign art schools
and universities. Every intellectual enterprise,
whether literary, artistic or scientific, found in
him a munificent patron. His entire income
was devoted to the welfare of the nation, and the
sums that Strossmayer spent in adding to the
greatness and fame of his country amounted
to many millions during the long years of his
office. But his dearest wish was the realization
of the Yougoslav ideal, the breaking down of all
local barriers between Serbs and Croats, and the
creation of a united people. With this end in
view, and in spite of his position in the Roman
Catholic Church, Strossmayer went so far as to
advocate that the Serbian Græco-Orthodox,
and the Croatian Catholic, Churches should unite
and become one National Church. He knew
that the future of his people could never be
realized within the confines of the Monarchy,
but that it must be identified with that of all
the other Southern Slav nations, and founded
upon a purely Slav basis. Strossmayer did not
confine his efforts to winning converts among
his own people for this idea. He knew too well,
that at the decisive moment the nation would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
require strong support from without, and, at the
risk of being accused of high treason, he entered
into friendly relations with Russia, which should
bring the big and powerful brother of the North
nearer to his down-trodden little brother in
the South. He succeeded in finding influential
friends in Russia as in other countries, and his
nation is still proud of his friendship with the Tsar
Alexander III., Leo XIII., Gladstone, Crispi and
Gambetta. Before Strossmayer entered the lists
no one in Europe had taken the slightest interest
in the Southern Slav problem. The slippery
diplomacy of Vienna&mdash;which is only equalled in
duplicity by that of Turkey&mdash;had for centuries
successfully diverted the attention of Europe
from the Southern Slav peoples in the Monarchy,
and the general assumption about them was that
they were a horde of uncivilized semi-barbarians,
fed by Austria at great sacrifice and treated
by her with the utmost forbearance. The
spectacles through which Europe viewed these
nations were made in Vienna and Budapest, and
no one took the trouble to bring an independent,
unbiassed mind to bear upon the problem.
Many Southern Slav patriots made desperate
though vain efforts to bring even a grain of truth
before the European public; a Jesuit Vienna
and a Judaized Budapest were too strong for
them. The world thought more of the colourless
anational Austrian culture, and the borrowed
pseudo-culture of the Magyars than of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
culture of the Slavs, which for a thousand years
has been the spontaneous expression of their
national individuality, with a literature worthy
of the lyre of Homer. Not only Austro-Hungarian
politics, but the age itself was unpropitious
to the Southern Slavs. They possessed
no importance for the European balance of power;
and it is one of the bitterest ironies of history,
that for a very long time the Southern Slavs
fought less for their own advantage than for the
interests of Europe. For, even as the Southern
Slavs were for centuries the bulwark against the
tide of Ottoman invasion <em>from</em> the East, they
subsequently became an equally strong bulwark
against the rising tide of Germanism <em>towards</em> the
East. With every fibre of their being they kept
the gate of the East fast closed against either
foe&mdash;not only for themselves, but in the interests
of European civilization.</p>

<p>Strossmayer was the first who succeeded in
re-awakening the interest of Europe in this
struggle, and, even if his efforts were not crowned
with immediate practical success, he at least contrived
to cast a doubt on the complacent assurances
of Vienna and Budapest. Strossmayer was
a man with a tremendous personality, and his
word was invariably accepted. He was also past-master
in the art of <em>not saying too much</em>&mdash;thus
avoiding the appearance of exaggeration. Even
in his world-famous speech in the Council of the
Vatican (1871, under Pius IX.), when he spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
in Latin for sixteen consecutive hours against the
doctrine of Papal infallibility, he left some things
unsaid, for he was interrupted in “the midst of
his speech” by the Archbishop of Paris, who embraced
and kissed him, and assured him that what
he had already said was amply convincing.</p>

<p>Strossmayer’s activity was pursued with ruthless
enmity in Vienna and Budapest, and, even
as he was the best-loved man among his own
people, he was the best-hated enemy of the
Germans and the Magyars. They tried by every
possible means to minimize his power, and
agitated in the Vatican for his recall to Rome.
But Leo XIII. was not only the personal friend
of Strossmayer, but also the friend of the Slavs,
and Viennese diplomacy failed in its object.
Then followed disgraceful intrigues, and endeavours
to represent Strossmayer as a traitor.
Among other accusations, it was alleged that he
had exchanged incriminating telegrams with the
Tsar, in which he was said to have advocated
the detachment of the Southern Slav provinces
from Austria. Strossmayer’s reply to these insinuations
was truly characteristic. Several years
after this alleged exchange of telegrams the
Emperor Francis Joseph came to Croatia for
the grand manœuvres, and Bishop Strossmayer
was one of the guests at the great reception
in Belovar, where the Emperor had his headquarters.
The Emperor took the opportunity
to sharply reprimand the Bishop for his conduct.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Strossmayer retorted with equal sharpness
“My conscience is clear, your Majesty,” then
brusquely turned his back and ostentatiously
walked out of the hall. Circumstances made it
impossible to celebrate Strossmayer’s courage,
but the people rejoiced in this new proof that
their champion feared no risk when it was a
case of defending the freedom and interests of his
people.</p>

<p>Strossmayer was no dreamer, but above all
things a practical statesman. He knew that
whoever hopes to win a final success must first
carefully prepare the ground. Any attempt to
detach the Southern Slav Kingdoms from the
Monarchy by force would have been unadvisable,
and moreover, a dangerous and futile enterprise.
Therefore, the political party of which Strossmayer
was the leader made it their business to see
that the stipulations of the Agreement were
scrupulously observed, knowing well that a strict
observance of the Agreement&mdash;if only for a time&mdash;would
give the nation the much-needed chance
of economic improvement, and thus pave the
way to future independence. In this policy
they were supported by the entire nation, who
by their very unanimity proved their political
fitness. Twenty years’ martyrdom under Count
Khuen-Hedervary had not enervated the nation;
on the contrary, they grew strong through
adversity; and, with their eyes fixed upon their
spiritual guide and protector, they steadfastly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
went forward towards their goal. Khuen-Hedervary’s
bribery, intimidation, everlasting trials for
high treason, prison and the gallows, all these had
only incited them to further resistance. When,
bowed with age, Strossmayer finally had to
resign his active part in politics, we saw the
people whom his spirit had inspired suddenly turn
upon their oppressors. In 1903, the whole country
rose in rebellion as one man, and Khuen-Hedervary’s
power was broken. Even he had to
admit that his twenty years’ rule of ruthless
oppression had merely defeated its own object,
that it had united the people whom he had sought
to weaken, and strengthened that which he had
hoped to destroy.</p>

<p>Strossmayer lived to see Khuen’s resignation,
and his last days were cheered by a gleam of
light&mdash;which alas! proved only illusory&mdash;shed
upon the path of his country; yet as he closed
his eyes for ever, he realized that he had not given
his all to Croatia in vain, and that the hour was not
far off when his ideals should become realities.</p>

<p>He died in 1905, but his spirit lives on in his
people and his memory shines among them like
a guiding star to point the way.</p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p>The popular rising in 1903 opened new channels
for the national struggle; it was also the prelude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
to the hardest and bitterest time that the
Southern Slav people have yet been called upon
to face. Khuen’s successor was Count Theodore
Pejacsević, a Croatian noble, who was no great
statesman, but at least a good administrative
official. He gave the distracted country a
brief time of quiet, equitable government, and
deserves great credit for abolishing Khuen’s
system of corruption. Meantime the strongly
Nationalist parties in Croatia had formed a
block,&mdash;the <em>Serbo-Croat Coalition</em>,&mdash;and Count
Pejacsević found it impossible to raise a pro-Hungarian
majority in Parliament. Shortly
afterwards the Hungarian Opposition also rose
into conflict with the Crown, and the situation
became involved both in Hungary and Croatia.
The Hungarian Opposition applied to the Serbo-Croat
Coalition for support in their struggle and
promised that, if their party were returned, they
would grant all Croatia’s demands as embodied
in the Agreement of 1867. Negotiations were
carried on by Francis Kossuth and Geza Polonyi
on behalf of Hungary, and by Frano Supilo as
delegate of the Serbo-Croat Coalition. These
negotiations resulted in the <cite>Resolution of Fiume</cite>
(October, 1905), which stipulated for the political
co-operation between the Hungarian and Serbo-Croat
parties, and secured considerable advantages
to Croatia in the event of success. The
Resolution of Fiume was in every way a masterpiece
of policy and diplomacy, and was in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
its details the achievement of Frano Supilo, who
was the popular leader in Croatia at the time.
In the election of 1905 the Coalition won a
brilliant victory. Not one Government candidate
was returned, and the small Opposition
consisted of partizans of Ante Starćević’s one-time
idealist, patriotic constitutionalist party, which
however, since his death, had passed under the
control of Jewish solicitors, and was so committed
to a purely Austrian <em>Christian-Socialist
policy</em>. As the Hungarian Opposition had likewise
scored a victory, the Croatian Cabinet was
composed of representatives of the Serbo-Croat
Coalition, with Count Pejacsević retained in
office as “ut conditio sine qua non.” Croatia
enjoyed a short respite and began to look forward
to better times. But her hopes were once more
doomed to disappointment. The perfidious
Magyars once more failed to keep their word.
So long as they <em>needed</em> the Serbs and Croats they
were full of love and brotherliness, but when
they had gained their point, they discarded the
mask of false friendship. Francis Kossuth,
having become Handelsminister (Minister of
Trade) in the Hungarian Cabinet in 1907, introduced
a bill on the control of the Railways which
was the most <em>flagrant</em> and <em>outrageous</em> infringement
of the Agreement as yet attempted. It provided
that thenceforth the language used on the
railway-system, even in Croatian territory, was
to be <em>Hungarian</em>, although it had been specially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
stipulated in the Agreement&mdash;which stands in
the place of a fundamental constitutional law&mdash;that
<em>Croatian</em> was to be official tongue in all
joint offices within Croatian territory. The
Serbo-Croat Coalition, which is represented by
forty members in the Hungarian Parliament, rose
in wrath against the Bill, and declared war to the
knife upon the Hungarian Government. The
conflict in the Hungarian Parliament is known
all over Europe. The Croats and Serbs pursued
a policy of obstruction, which fairly paralyzed
the House and made parliamentary discussion
of the Railway Bill quite impossible. To get
it passed Kossuth so worded his Bill that it was
contained in one paragraph, empowering the
Government to deal with the Pragmatic (administrative
business of the country) at their
discretion as part of the Order of the Day.</p>

<p>The rupture with Hungary was now complete.
The Serbo-Croat Coalition transferred the conflict
to Croatia, and the nation began to agitate for
detachment from Hungary. The Parliament
was dissolved, but the Coalition was again
victorious in the election. On the resignation
of the Croatian Government, Alexander v.
Rakodczay was appointed Ban, but failing to
raise a party friendly to the Government he was
forced to resign his office in two months. The
next Ban to be appointed was Baron Paul Rauch,
who boldly entered his capital town of Zagreb,
but was received with hostile demonstrations and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
showers of stones. It speaks well for his courage
that he was not affected by this reception, and
even introduced himself to the Parliament with
great pomp. His reception in Parliament was
one great demonstration of hostility, so that he
could not even read the Royal message. He
had to fly the building with his Ministerial staff,
and Parliament was officially dissolved the same
day. Baron Rauch formed a Government party
of venal upstarts and discredited characters,
secured the support of the now thoroughly
demoralized “constitutionalist party,” and
ordered a new election. <em>Everything</em> was done
to intimidate the electorate, with the result that
not one of Rauch’s candidates was returned.
This Parliament was dissolved without even
having been summoned, and Rauch embarked
on a reign of terror which can only be compared
to that of Germany in the Cameroons. He
organized the Jewish-constitutionalist party into
bands which went by the name of the “Black
Hand.” Their motto was “For the Emperor,
and for Croatia,” and their weapons were murder
and assault, which they were allowed to use with
impunity against their opponents. At the same
time an organized judicial persecution of the
Serbs was set on foot. But even this tyranny
could not break the national resistance.</p>

<p>At this juncture a new contingency arose.
The Monarchy was preparing to annex Bosnia
and Hercegovina, and a suitable pretext had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
be found. The Government accordingly invented
the “<em>Greater Serbian agitation</em>.” The heroic
struggle of the Serbo-Croat Coalition was represented
as being the outcome of a Greater Serbian
agitation, and Baron Rauch was commissioned
to unmask this “widespread criminal conspiracy.”
In the summer of 1908, to the amazement
and consternation of the people, large
numbers of Serbs, chiefly priests, school-masters
and business men, were arrested, and the official
Press triumphantly announced that a horrible,
widespread and highly treasonable propaganda
had been discovered! The preliminary investigations
lasted a long time, and March 3rd, 1909,
saw the opening of the proceedings against the
“traitors” who had conspired with Serbia for
the detachment of all the Slavonic South from
the Monarchy. The trial lasted till October 5th,
when all the accused parties received very heavy
sentences. Immediately afterwards the Austrian
historian Dr. Heinrich Friedjung stated in the
Viennese <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Neue Freie Presse</cite>, that the leaders of
the Serbo-Croat Coalition were also implicated
in this conspiracy, especially Frano Supilo,
Grga Tuškan and Božidar Vinković, and that
his accusation was founded on documentary
evidence. Hereupon the whole Serbo-Croat
Coalition took proceedings against Dr. Friedjung
for libel. The result of this case, which was
fought in Vienna, caused a European sensation.
<em>It was conclusively proved that all the documentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
evidence against the Coalition, both in the Zagreb
and the Viennese trials, had been forged by order
of Baron Aehrenthal, the Minister for Foreign
Affairs, and Count Forgach, the Austrian Ambassador
in Belgrade.</em> Friedjung himself confessed
as much in court. The consequence
of this unparalleled <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">exposé</em> was, that the King-Emperor
had to rescind the sentences already
passed in the Zagreb trial.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> Meantime, however,
the desired object had been gained, and Bosnia-Hercegovina
was annexed contrary to the will
of all the Slavs.</p>

<p>But, with scandalous details incidental to
the annexation, Baron Rauch’s mission had been
brilliantly fulfilled. Soon afterwards Kossuth’s
perfidious Government was turned out and
Croatia’s old oppressor, Count Khuen Hedervary,
became Premier. Khuen, however, was a
personal enemy of Rauch, and occasioned his
recall. In his place Nikolaus von Tomašić
was appointed Ban of Croatia&mdash;a most eminent
and highly-respected Croatian scholar, but
politically a satellite of Khuen. He did his
best to restore order, and to this end negotiated
with the Serbo-Croat Coalition. Frano Supilo
protested most emphatically against this. He
had already had exhaustive experience of Magyar
perfidy, and had no desire to see his people once
again walk into the trap. But the Coalition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
was perhaps weary of the struggle&mdash;perhaps
they still hoped for fair dealing, and accordingly
entered into a compact with Tomašić which
made peaceful government possible so long as
the rights of the nation were respected. On
the strength of this compact several Government
candidates were returned at the next
election; after which Tomašić promptly ignored
the Coalition and governed only with his
own party. Supilo’s prophecy was fulfilled,
and the Coalition had once more to join the
Opposition. Tomašić was overthrown but the
Austro-Hungarian Government replied by sending
Herr von Cuvaj, the Terrorist Commissioner,
and suspending the Constitution. These were
the days of bitterest misery and unscrupulous
tyranny in Croatia. Cuvaj ruled with the knout,
and the knout only. Police espionage flourished,
and all personal, political and civil liberty
was set at naught. All this time the Balkan
War was raging, and woe to the Serb or
Croat who dared to rejoice at his brother’s
victories. But, when the Balkan Alliance was
victorious, the Southern Slavs knew that from
henceforth they could rely on a measure of
support from their kinsmen. Vienna and
Budapest were equally perspicacious and realized
the advisability of changing their tactics.
Cuvaj was recalled and Count Stephen Tisza,
one of the most inveterate enemies of the Slavs,
sent Baron Skerlecz to Croatia with instructions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
to conciliate the Croats. The effete Serbo-Croat
Coalition was once more cajoled, and, for the
third time, it entered into a disastrous compact
with Hungary. This time one of the consequences
was the expropriation of the Croatian
sea-board in favour of Hungary. Moreover,
the present crisis found the Coalition helplessly
committed to the Government.</p>

<p>But the people had stood firm. The dire
sufferings of recent years have begotten a new
and healthy movement, which includes the
entire youth of Croatia. The younger generation
has lost faith in political parties, and begun to
go its own way along the path which leads
away from Hungary and away from Austria,
back to union with their scattered kindred.
Their aim is the establishment of a great, free
and independent Southern Slav State. At the
head of this younger generation stands a man
of magnetic personality&mdash;Frano Supilo.</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>The Southern Slavs in Dalmatia, Carniola and
Istria fared little better than their brothers in
Croatia and Slavonia. I have already alluded
to the economic neglect of Dalmatia. In
politics, Germanization was practised in much
the same way as Magyarization in Croatia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
Dalmatia unfortunately does not enjoy independence,
even on paper, and thus her oppression
could wear a perfectly constitutional guise. The
Dalmatian “Sabor,” like that of Istria and
Carniola, is an assembly quite at the mercy of
the viceroy for the time being, who would never
dream of convoking it, unless he had made quite
sure that no inconvenient resolutions would be
passed. As a rule these “Sabors” enjoy prolonged
periods of rest, and the people are only
represented by their delegates in the Viennese
Reichstrat. There these delegates certainly
make a brave fight, but they are too few, and
their voice is drowned by the huge German
majority. Because of this and also through the
fault of the Slovene Roman Catholic party,
Carniola has become strongly Germanized,
especially as regards the administration of the
schools. But the Dalmatians and Istrians are
a sturdy, progressive people, Slav to the backbone,
and all attempts at Germanizing them
have proved as futile as the beating of waves
upon the shore. Beside the German danger,
this people also has the Italian danger to contend
with. For opportunist reasons the Austrian
Government has always favoured the Italian
element (4 per cent. in Istria and 2 per cent. in
Dalmatia) and granted them concessions, which
have given rise to the most absurd anomalies.
For instance, the election law in Istria is so
framed, that 96 per cent. Slovenes and Croats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
send fewer delegates to Vienna than 4 per cent.
Italians. The same injustice prevails in the
Parish Council election law, but in spite of this
the Italians would never secure their majority,
if special Government regulations did not compel
all officials and State employees to vote Italian.
<em>If to-day Italy is apparently able to claim a sphere
of interest in Istria, this is the outcome of a chance
state of affairs, arbitrarily created by the Austrian
Government.</em> As an instance of this policy, I
will state that shortly before the outbreak of
the war the Government seriously contemplated
the foundation of an Italian University for a
population of 700,000 souls, while strenuously
opposing the foundation of a Slovene University
for 1,400,000 Slovenes and Croats
in Carniola and Istria. Of course this
policy made the Italians aggressive, and they
continued to extend their sphere of interest
until it actually included the Quarnero Islands,
although these islands do not possess one single
Italian inhabitant, and <em>these very islands are the
most sacred possession of the Southern Slavs</em>.
<span class="smcap">They are the only spot in Slav territory
where the old Slav tongue is still spoken
by the people.</span> This fact is amply borne out
by publications of the Southern Slav Academy,
and also of the Russian Academy, which sends
its scholars year by year to these islands to study
the language. In the province of Dalmatia the
populace have themselves dismissed the Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
question from the order of the day, and the local
government of Zadar (Zara) is the only possession&mdash;and
a very problematical one at that&mdash;which
the Italians might claim, and that only
because of the truly mediæval election laws. For,
as soon as vote by ballot for the Parliamentary
elections was introduced in the Austrian Crown
lands, the Croatian candidate was returned by a
majority of 7,000 votes over his Italian colleague.</p>

<p>The pro-Italian attitude of Austria was and
is as insincere as the rest of her policy. It
is simply dictated by the “<em>divide-et-impera</em>”
principle, because an alliance between Slavs and
Italians would have been fatal to the Government.
One nationality was played off against the
other, and the Italians proved willing tools in
the hands of Austria. The influence of Italian
culture, which has for centuries been received
with love and admiration by the Southern
Slavs, has created an Italian-speaking zone of
culture in the coast-lands of the Adriatic; and
the Italians, assisted by the Austrian Government,
have made the most of this zone until
they have actually had the audacity to include
it in their sphere of <em>national</em> aspirations. Thus
Austria created an enemy both for herself and
the Slav peoples, an enemy with whom the
Southern Slavs have never before had any real
quarrel. Antagonism led to bitter conflicts, and
if the Slav population in Dalmatia and Istria
have begun to detest the Italian zone of culture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
it has been purely in self-defence and for fear of
having to pay with their national existence
for the amity and admiration of centuries.
Nowadays, the Italians themselves admit that
Dalmatia and Istria are indigenously pure Slav
countries. Probably the present struggle has
also revealed to them the true value of Austria’s
favours.</p>

<p>In Bosnia and Hercegovina, Austria pursued
the same heartless policy. Out of the three
religions of <em>one</em> people she made <em>three</em> nationalities,
and then fostered dissensions between
them. Her policy was especially bitter against
the Serbs, who are in the majority and also the
more highly-educated element of the population
and therefore more able to give effective support
to the just claims of Serbia. Austria was not
in the least interested in the prosperity of the
country, and merely created an intolerable chaos
by her political intrigue in a land that had already
suffered beyond endurance. Her evidences of
civilization exhibited before Europe were pure
humbug, and the annexation of Bosnia-Hercegovina
one of the most flagrant acts of injustice
ever perpetrated on a nation.</p>

<p>If the present war is decided in favour of the
Allies&mdash;and this is the prayer of <em>all</em> the Slavs&mdash;it
will become necessary to settle the Southern
Slav problem once and for all. This can only
be done <em>satisfactorily</em> by respecting the principle
of nationality, and by a just delimitation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
various national zones. In disputed territories,
such as Istria or the Quarnero Islands, a referendum
ought to decide.</p>

<p>The Slavs have been tortured long enough.
For centuries they have guarded European
civilization against the inroads of <em>Ottoman Islam</em>,
which has always been synonymous with bigotry,
barbarism and sloth, and should never be confounded
with <em>Arab Islam</em>, or <em>Hindu Islam</em>, to
whom the whole world of science, art and
philosophy is eternally indebted. Austria and
Prussia are the natural heirs of Ottoman Islam,
and the Southern Slavs have made a heroic stand
against this latter-day <em>Prussian Islam</em>.</p>

<p>Civilization owes them a debt of honour, and
it is only their due that Europe should give them
justice.</p>

<small>“BURIED TREASURES.”</small><br />

<small><small><small>BY DIMITRIJ MITRINOVIĆ.</small></small></small></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Speaking</span> generally, the Southern Slavs are
divided into Slovenes, Serbo-Croats, and Bulgarians,
but of these three branches only the
Slovenes and Serbo-Croats are racially identical.
In speaking of a political Southern Slav State, a
state which would in the future dominate the
<em>whole</em> of the Balkan Peninsula, it would be wrong
not to include the Bulgarian nation. However,
the Serbo-Croats form the principal cultural
“unit” among the Southern Slavs, and after them
come the Slovenes. The nucleus, the life-giving
element of the Southern Slav family and its
culture, is formed by the Southern Slavs of Serbia,
Old Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Hercegovina,
Croatia, Dalmatia and Serbian Hungary, or,
to give them their collective name, by the Serbo-Croats.
The Serbo-Croats, and more especially
the Serbians proper (Serbians of Old Serbia and
Serbia), have always led the vanguard of Serbo-Croatian
political life; the two greatest cultural
achievements of the Southern Slav race, to wit,<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
the national poetry and the individual architecture
and sculpture of Ivan Meštrović, have always
been associated with the Serbians of Serbia.
The fall of the Serbian Empire forms the chief
theme of Meštrović’s art, no less than of Southern
Slav national poetry&mdash;and thus it has become
usual, if not strictly correct, to speak of all
Southern Slav poetry as Serbian national poetry,
and of the great Southern Slav artist as the great
Serbian artist.</p>

<p>We speak of the Southern Slav poetry and of
Ivan Meštrović, our Southern Slav Michelangelo,
as “buried treasures.” In a sense, all Slav
civilization may be called a buried treasure.
Russian and Slav literature as a whole, is far
greater than its reputation in Western Europe.
Ottokar Brezina, the celebrated Csech poet, is
translated and read in Slavophobe Germany, but
not in allied France and England; because in these
days nations are more often brought into contact
by war and travel than by civilization and our
common humanity.</p>

<p>Western Europe has been even less just to
the Southern Slavs than to any other Slav nation;
and they who have paid so dearly in blood and
suffering for their freedom are less known and
recognized than any other European nation, in
spite of the great historic merit of the Serbians,
and the importance of their culture;&mdash;the consideration
shown by Europe to a dynasty has been
greater than her justice to a portion of mankind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
A universal conflagration and a breaking-up of the
old order of things was necessary, ere Europe
learned to value millions of human beings more
highly than the principle of a bygone generation,
or the pathos of old age. In the future we may
hope to see a just Europe which will not look
upon the Serbians as a nation of regicides, but
as a people revolting against secret treaties with
the Hapsburgs, and upon the Southern Slavs, not
as traitors, but as a democratic people refusing
to be destroyed. When the Slovenes of Istria,
Carniola, Styria, and Carinthia, together with
the Serbo-Croats, form a strong, prosperous and
free, though small State, their culture will be
developed to the full, crowning and unifying
Southern Slav life.</p>

<p>This growing civilization of Greater Serbia,
which may be called <em>Yougoslavia</em>, will gather up
the scattered threads of the history of Serbian
art in the past. We shall then no longer speak
of “Slovene painting,” “Croatian drama,” “Old
Serbian tapestry,” “Serbian folk-lore.” The
literature of one and the same people will cease
to be broken up into “Literature in Ragusa,”
“Dalmatian Island and Coast Literature,” “Bosnian,”
“Croatian,” and “Serbian” literature.
All this, together with the national life to the
State, will form the <em>totality of the Southern Slav
nation</em>. The two zones of culture: the Western
European zone of the Croats and Slovenes,
and the Eastern-Byzantine zone of the Serbians;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
the three religions: Orthodox, Catholic and
Mussulman; the two forms of script: the Latin
of the Croats, and the Cyrillic of the Serbians;
all these, as well as a few differences of speech, will
only add to the wealth and originality of Southern
Slav culture. When this Greater Serbia or
<em>Yougoslavia</em> shall stand for the third great civilization
of the Balkans (the first was Hellenic, the
second Byzantine), the Southern Slavs will
become a new factor in European civilization
and politics, and the great art of Serbian national
poetry, and the work of the Yougoslav artist,
Meštrović, will no longer be buried treasures.
Serbian music, literature and science, although
they have existed and still exist, will only then
be known and recognized.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<p>It has been the fate of the Southern Slavs to
fulfil a mission in European history; Serbia and
the Serbo-Croat race constituted a bulwark for
Europe and Christianity against the invasion of
Turkish barbarians and Islam. The martyrdom
of the Southern Slavs lasted for centuries; it was
a most humiliating thraldom to the barbarous
Mongolism of the Ottoman Turks, and a hard,
incessant fight for the dignity of humanity. It
was a period of indescribable suffering from the
barbarities of a lower race, one of the hardest
struggles for existence the world has known. It
was impossible to continue or to realize the plans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
of the great Nemanjić rulers. All attempts at
union between the peoples of Croatia and Bosnia
were fruitless: <em>never in the history of Europe has a
nation lived for so many centuries in such terrible
political impotence and disunion as the Serbo-Croat
and Slovene nation</em>. Italy at the time
of the Renaissance, and Germany before the
liberation, were, in comparison with the Southern
Slavs, in a well-organized and healthy condition.</p>

<p>Thus it has come about that we have no
Serbian history of art, only various provincial
histories&mdash;Old Serbian, Macedonian, Dalmatian,
Bosnian, History of Serbian art in Hungary,
Slovene and New Serbian.</p>

<p>The bitter enmity of Austria-Hungary towards
Serbia, which deepened steadily, and finally
became the direct cause of the European War,
began with the Russophile and Southern Slav
trend of Serbian policy after the series of Southern
Slav Congresses, which took place in Belgrade at
the time of the coronation of King Peter in 1904.
Serbia’s new policy, after the suicidal and humiliating
pro-Austrian policy of the Obrenović dynasty
had been abolished, was a <em>racial policy</em>, pro-Russian,
pro-Bulgarian and democratic, which restored the
stability and order of the State, and led to the
foundation of the Balkan Alliance in 1912. Serbia
regenerated, sought to consolidate a scattered,
provincial culture into one great culture of a
Greater Serbia, or of all the Southern Slavs. For
this reason it has only quite recently become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
possible to speak of the united cultural efforts of
the Serbo-Croats.</p>

<p>The consolidation of Southern Slav history
and culture are only now beginning, and the
appearance of the artist-prophet Ivan Meštrović,
a Dalmatian Catholic, is the central event in
Southern Slav history of art. He is the prophet
of the third, or Southern Slav Balkan, State,
who proclaims that it is the historical task of
Serbia to free the Southern Slavs and unite them,
not only in a political, but in a spiritual, sense;
and he has symbolized this ideal in his great
art, which is the living soul of the architecture
and sculpture of the <cite>Temple of Kossovo</cite>, and of all
the Southern Slavs. When the Balkans are
freed from Ottoman Islam and the Turks, when
a strong and progressive Federation of Southern
Slavs, including Bulgaria, Roumania, Greece
and even Albania, is established, then we may
see the triumphant rise of a mature and typically
Southern Slav culture. When all nations shall
receive their due, when they are allowed to
develop freely, then and only then, the blood-drenched
Peninsula will be at peace. A strong
and prosperous Yougoslavia will interest the
world both politically and economically; the
opinion that the Southern Slavs are an uncivilized
race will cease, and the great services rendered
to art and letters by the Serbo-Croats and Slovenes
will be recognized and appreciated at their
true value. If we include Meštrović’s <cite>Temple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
of Kossovo</cite> among these achievements, we may
fairly claim to have contributed to the greatest
possessions of human culture for all time.</p>

<p>The life-work of the Serbian Monarchs of the
Nemanjić dynasty, who aimed at the inclusion of
Serbia within the zone of the then-civilized
nations of Europe, failed of its fulfilment, owing
to the fall of the Serbian Empire before the
Turks. The Serbo-Byzantine architecture of
the convents and churches which abound in
Macedonia and Serbia, affords admirable proof of
the results of this work, the most important
examples being Studenitza (1198), Dečani (1331),
and Gračanica (1341). A few years later culture
made great strides in Dalmatia, but it was
not a spontaneous, national growth, but rather
the offspring of Slavicized Latin culture, and
savoured more of Venice and the Renaissance
than of Dalmatia and the Southern Slavs.
Furthermore, the artists, scientists, philosophers
and writers of Dalmatia went to Italy and were
lost to their nation. The poor, down-trodden,
uncivilized Southern Slav countries could not
provide their artists with a livelihood. The
celebrated mathematician, philosopher and
astronomer, Roger Bošković, went to Rome, Paris,
and London; Nikolo Tomasso, a Serbian from
Sevenico, founded the Italian literary language.
Julije Lovranić (Laurana), an eminent architect
of his time, was a Serbian from Dalmatia, and
at one time the teacher of Bramante; and Franjo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Laurana, of Palermo, a kinsman of Julije, earned
a high place in the history of art through his
sculpture; he was especially celebrated for his
beautiful female portrait busts. In like manner
many Serbians found their way to other countries.
For instance, Peter Križanić, a Croatian, was
the first Pan-Slavist; he was exiled to Siberia
for his schemes of reform and European propaganda
in Russia. To this day the Dalmatian
ships’ captains are not the only representatives
of that country all the world over, but great
scientists and inventors like Pupin and Nikola
Tesla.</p>

<p>Whenever a part of Serbian territory became
independent, or even for a short time found
tolerable conditions, an intense creative culture
grew up swiftly, even after the fall of the Empire
and during the time of slavery. For generations
the greater part of the Serbians have lived, and
still live, in slavery. The Serbians under Turkish
rule were liberated only two years ago, and the
liberation of the Slavs of the Hapsburg Monarchy
is only just beginning. In accordance with the
changes in the political fate of the Southern
Slavs, and as the material conditions of the
people grew better or worse, the centres of Slav
literature moved from place to place. This
unfortunate disorganization and consequent impotence
were the bane of Serbian or Southern Slav
literature. Ragusan literature; the literature of
the Dalmatian coast and its islands, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
original creations, and many fine translations of
the Greek drama&mdash;Homer, Virgil and Horace,
Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Tasso, Ariosto&mdash;none
of these counted in the later development
of literature in Croatia, Serbian Hungary, Bosnia
or Serbia. As things now stand, Slovenian
literature bears no recognized relation to Serbo-Croat
literature, which has to a certain extent
become unified. The great Croatian poets, Peter
Preradović, Ivan Mažuranić, and Silvije Kranjčević
are scarcely read in Serbia, owing to bitter
political disagreements and the Austrian <em>divide-et-impera</em>
policy. For this reason, too, the
Croatians scarcely know the greatest Southern
Slav poets such as the Montenegrin Petar Petrović
Njegoš, or the Serbian from Hungary, Lazar
Kostić. The historian and philosopher Boža
Knižević and the metaphysician Branislav
Petronijević are scarcely known in Bosnia owing
to their being Serbians from Serbia, that is to
say, from anti-Austrian Serbia. Thus it is
scarcely surprising that Southern Slav culture
is unknown in Europe, when it is practically
unknown even in Yougoslavia; when Meštrović,
the immortal artist of Yougoslavia, the architect
and sculptor of the Serbian Acropolis, is unknown
to his own countrymen beyond the frontier.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<p>At present the nation is fighting for its very life.
<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inter arma silent musæ</em>, and when a nation has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
to bear first the occupation and then the annexation
of the heart of its territory; when it has to
wage an incessant war, even in times of so-called
peace, against an implacable neighbour like
Austria-Hungary; when the strength of the nation
is absorbed in the mere struggle for <em>existence</em>; then
it is impossible to realize the possession of a great
artist. The Serbian nation has waged three
wars of life and death, and always against an
enemy stronger than herself; first against
Turkey, then against Bulgaria, and now against
Austria&mdash;all within three years. At such a time
it is impossible to create a great civilization, and
still less possible not to appear to the world as a
nation created solely for war. Diplomatic Europe
is interested in Serbian politics&mdash;<em>not</em> from motives
of humanity and justice. And to the Europe of
civilization, philosophy, science, art and ethics
the spirit of Yougoslavia is not even a name.
Who knows that even apart from Meštrović&mdash;who,
as the peer of Phidias and Michelangelo, cannot be
compared with mere mortals&mdash;the finest architect
of the present day is a Southern Slav&mdash;a Slovene&mdash;the
son of a small nation of three million
people? This great architect of modern Europe
is Josip Plečnik; he was director of the Arts
Academy in Prague, and a few months ago was
promoted to the Vienna Academy. Downtrodden
Dalmatia boasts such powerful writers,
thinkers and scientists as Count Ivo Vojnović,
Antun Tresić-Pavićić, the philosopher Petrić, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
the historian Nodilo. At the time of Carducci
and Swinburne Bosnia possessed a typical poet,
Silvije Kranjčević, and at the present time
Serbia has in Borislav Stankovi a novelist
worthy to rank with Leonid Andreeff. In
Yougoslavia there are to-day splendidly edited
reviews, particularly good theatres and opera
(as for instance the Opera at Zagreb), and good
universities with distinguished professors and
scientific men. Assuredly the Southern Slavs
are not to blame if the whole world has seen
this gifted and important nation through the
spectacles of the Viennese Press, a nation which
is worth more to the human race than the whole
of the Hapsburg dynasty&mdash;or <em>was</em>, until the outbreak
of the present war.... In all their
poverty and slavery, and without the help even
of Serbia, they undertook a campaign of enlightenment
in the European Press, organized art exhibitions,
and by concerts, lectures, and translations
made known their art and literature to the world.
English literature has greatly influenced Serbo-Croat
literature; and not only Shakespeare,
Dickens, Byron and Shelley are translated into
Serbian, but Carlyle, Buckle, and Draper have
also exercised great influence upon Serbian
culture; and the most modern literature of Britain
has found worthy translators and admirers.
The poems of Rossetti, Browning, Keats, Swinburne
and Walt Whitman, the novels of Wells,
and the plays of Bernard Shaw have been trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>lated
into the beautiful tongue of the “Belgrade
regicides.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<p>To resume, it is not surprising that Western
Europeans do not know Southern Slav civilization,
when many rich fields of this culture still
remain “buried treasures” to the Southern
Slavs themselves. The Serbo-Croat and Slovene
poets, such as Gundulić, Ranjina, Palmotić and
Gjorgjić from Ragusa and Dalmatia, compare
favourably with the exponents of Western literature,
and among modern Serbo-Croat poets
Petar Petrović Njegoš, Lazar Kostić and Silvije
Kranjčević are great, even when compared with
the greatest. Yet it is not so much the artists
and their individual works, but the <em>nation</em>, and
the <em>collective artistic worth</em> of the national spirit
that is of priceless value. The music of the
Southern Slavs, more especially the music of Old
Serbia and Bosnia, possesses great melodic beauty
and emotional depth, and when it finds its modern
exponent it will take its proper place in the
history of music. This great art of the Serbian
nation however, is not only absolutely unknown
to Europe and the rest of the world, but even
in Serbia, although universally known, it is
cultivated little or not at all. The Serbian State,
which since its re-birth under Karagjorgje
Petrović has waged continual war for the liberty
and union of the Southern Slavs, could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
devote itself to music, art and beauty; and that
part of the nation which remains under the yoke
of the Ottoman Turks and the Hapsburgs felt
still less inclined to do so. The priceless treasures
of popular song have not yet been artistically
exploited. Thus their own creation is a buried
treasure to the Southern Slavs; in a sense, one
may even say, that there is no Serbian music.
Europeans cannot value this beautiful and noble
music because they do not know it; neither
can they value the national textile art of
Old Serbia, Dalmatia and Croatia, since it is
equally unknown. For three consecutive years
the Serbian Government has had to arm the
State, and has had neither time nor money to turn
the Southern Slav textile art into a modern
industry.</p>

<p>What the Serbo-Croats and Slovenes, and even
the Bulgarians, do cultivate, and are proud of,
is the Southern-Slav or Serbian national poetry,
the ballads and legends which the people have
invented and sung during centuries of slavery.
Goethe, the great “citizen of the universe,” and
the first to predict the foundation of a modern
universal literature, assigned Serbian national
poetry a very high place among the literatures
of the world, and many of the poems have already
been translated into different languages.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>To understand Ivan Meštrović, the creator of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
the <cite>Temple of Kossovo</cite>, one must feel Serbian
music and appreciate Serbian textile art; and
above all one must learn to know this noble
nation of Christians and Slavs through their
national poetry. It is not arrogance on our
part to call Meštrović and the <cite>Temple of Kossovo</cite>
the eternal art of the present generation. Every
divinely-inspired artist creates not only beauty,
but life,&mdash;for the mind is the life&mdash;and this great
regenerator of European art is the son of a small
nation of the blood-stained Balkans, and also
the son of the great race which has produced
Dostoievski.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<p>Europe and mankind in general must accord
justice to the Southern Slav spirit, and the
historic merit and achievements of the Serbian
nation. The knowledge of Serbian music and
especially of Serbian poetry can only be a gain
to the Europe of the future. For this Serbian
art is a <em>truly Slav art</em>, wonderful and deep, equal
to that of ancient Egypt and India. It was
not because Miczkiewicz, the great Polish poet,
was himself a Slav, that he sang the praises of
this beauty so enthusiastically, but because he
understood the moral of this beauty. This
poetry has been for centuries a life-force of
the Southern Slav nation, because morality and
life are one, and because the spirit of Serbian
beauty&mdash;barbaric and god-like&mdash;is a religion in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
poetry and a moral in art. Without fear we may
say that Serbian ethics are the most wonderful
in the history of humanity. If it may be said
of any nation that it is great and noble, it may
be said of the Southern Slavs. Europe does not
realize the monstrous injustice she has done these
“barbarous” peoples. They are rather a heroic
and mythical than a barbaric people. It is only
Austria-Hungary who regards them as a nation
of anarchists and regicides.</p>

<p>What is the Serbian spirit? It has been twice
manifested. Once through a man, Ivan Meštrović,
the prophet of the Slav Balkans, and again
through the whole nation, in the thousands of
legends, fairy-tales, ballads and songs which have
been collected by Vuk Stefanović-Karadžić.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
The occupation of Bosnia, then the national
catastrophe of the annexation of Bosnia, and
finally the Balkan War have already become
the subjects of poetry, and our own time will see
the latest and greatest war of the Southern Slavs
sung in all its heroic reality.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
